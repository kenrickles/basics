# 10.3 Card Game Example

I implemented the [card game war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_%28card_game%29) as an example of how to think about the logic of a program and the step-by-step process of how to build the different parts.

{% hint style="info" %}
### Exercise

Read the wikipedia page above and write out the pseudocode for this card game.

Make the first step as if you were to build the game from scratch yourself.

If you need to / want to, clone a copy of the starter code to work out some ideas.

Do you know how you would start the game and which parts you would work on first?

After you're done begin the videos and see how things went similarly or differently from how you imagined. 
{% endhint %}

## Part 1

In this video I dissect the pseudo code for the game and implement a simple version.

## Part 2

In this video I implement the war mode of the game when the players have the same card. 

I run into a JavaScript error that tells me something new about how I wrote my code.

## Part 3

After finishing a version of the war mode condition and running into an error, in this video I work into the error and figure out how to solve it and some other issues that come up in the logic of my game.

I analyze the errors I get and the behaviour to work backwards to fill in the missing game logic, and I use fake data to confirm that my logic works.

## Part 4

I know that the logic I've constructed so far is sound and error free.

I still have an issue of not moving the cards around so I implement that for the war mode, then backtrack to make sure it works for the rest of the game.

## Solution

```javascript
// the rules of the game

// the objective is to win all the cards

// the deck is suffled and split evenly among the players

// players take turns drawing one card

// whoever has the highest card wins

// if the cards are equal, it's "war"

// if its war

// one card is drawn face down

// one card is drawn face up

// the highest face up card wins

// the winner gets all the cards (is for war or not)

// if the players both run out of cards, its a tie
// if one player runs out of cards they lose

var main = function (input) {

  // deal cards
  var playerCard = playerHand.pop();
  var computerCard = computerHand.pop();


  var myOutputValue = '';
  myOutputValue = myOutputValue + 'PLAYER: ' + playerCard.name + ' of ' + playerCard.suit + '<br>COMPUTER ' + computerCard.name + ' of ' + computerCard.suit+'<br>';

  if (playerCard.rank > computerCard.rank) {
    console.log("player wins")

    // give the winner cards
    playerHand.unshift(playerCard);
    playerHand.unshift(computerCard);

    myOutputValue = myOutputValue + 'USER WINS!<br>';

  } else if (playerCard.rank < computerCard.rank) {

    // give the winner cards
    computerHand.unshift(playerCard);
    computerHand.unshift(computerCard);

    console.log("computer wins")
    myOutputValue = myOutputValue + 'COMPUTER WINS!<br>';

  } else {

    console.log('equallllll');
    // it's war
    myOutputValue = myOutputValue + 'Its WAAARRRRR<br>';

    var warCards = [];

    // variable that will end the loop
    var cardsEqual = true;

    while (cardsEqual) {

      console.log("ITS WAR LOOP");


      // one card is drawn face down
      var playerFaceDown = playerHand.pop();
      var computerFaceDown = computerHand.pop();

      // hold all the cards for the winner of war

      // the winner gets all the cards
      if (playerFaceUp.rank > computerFaceUp.rank) {

        // end the loop
        cardsEqual = false;
        playerHand.push(warCards)

      } else if (playerFaceUp.rank < computerFaceUp.rank) {
        console.log("computer wins war")
        // end the loop
        cardsEqual = false;
        computerHand = addArray(warCards, computerHand);
      }

      // if the cards are equal, repeat war
      myOutputValue = myOutputValue + '<br>PLAYER: ' + playerFaceUp.name + ' of ' + playerFaceUp.suit + '<br>COMPUTER ' + computerFaceUp.name + ' of ' + computerFaceUp.suit;

      // if all the cards are gone
      // if the players hands are empty


      // if both players have zero or one cards left- its a tie
      // we card draw one face down and one face up - end game
      if ((playerHand.length == 0 && computerHand.length == 0) || (playerHand.length == 1 && computerHand.length == 1)) {
        // end the loop
        cardsEqual = false;
        myOutputValue = myOutputValue + '<br> GAME OVER! TIE'

      // the player loses
      // the player has zero cards, or the player has zero cards and the computer has more than one card
      } else if ((playerHand.length == 0 && computerHand.length != 0) || (playerHand.length == 1 && computerHand.length > 1)) {

        // end the loop
        cardsEqual = false;

        myOutputValue = myOutputValue + '<br> GAME OVER! YOU LOSE'

      // the computer loses
      // the computer has zero cards, or the computer has one card and the player has more than one card
      } else if ((computerHand.length == 0 && playerHand.length != 0) || (computerHand.length == 1 && playerHand.length > 1)) {

// the deck is suffled and split evenly among the players
var playerHand = deck.splice(0, 26);

```

## Post Mortem

There are a few different ways that building a game like this may be approached.

Another valid order to build the parts would have been to distribute the cards earlier before working out all the logic.

This might vary depending on how complicated the game was or how simple / complicated the logic was- if the logic for the game was any more complicated I might not wait til the end to implement an \*action\* in the game like distributing the cards.

I could have also decided to implement each drawing of the war cards as a new turn of the game- a running of the main function / clicking of the submit button. In that case I would have set a global variable with the game mode as "war".

In a more complex project it is also common that I attempt one approach and finally decide on another, if I begin to feel like it needs to be built in a certain order or that it will be easier another way.
