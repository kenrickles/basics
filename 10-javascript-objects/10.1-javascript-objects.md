High Card is a card game where each player draws a random card, and the player with the highest card wins. Below is a sample implementation of High Card. We will soon be creating other card games, combining all we have learned so far in Coding Basics.

In the following implementation, we use the JS array `pop` method to draw a random card from the deck. `pop` removes and returns the last array element \(i.e. draws a card from the top of the deck\). We can rely on `pop` to draw a random card because the deck is already shuffled.

After drawing cards, we can use the cards' `rank` attributes to compare which is higher.

```javascript
// Initialise the card deck representation as an array of objects
var cardDeck = [
  // card1,
  // card2,
  // ...
];

// Shuffle the deck and save it in a new variable shuffledCardDeck
// to communicate that we have shuffled the deck.
var shuffledCardDeck = shuffleCards(cardDeck);

var main = function (input) {
  // Draw 2 cards from the top of the deck
  var computerCard = shuffledCardDeck.pop();
  var playerCard = shuffledCardDeck.pop();

  // Construct an output string to communicate which cards were drawn
  var myOutputValue =
    'Computer had ' +
    computerCard.name +
    ' of ' +
    computerCard.suit +
    '. Player had ' +
    playerCard.name +
    ' of ' +
    playerCard.suit +
    '. ';

  // Compare computer and player cards by rank attribute
  // If computer card rank is greater than player card rank, computer wins
  if (computerCard.rank > playerCard.rank) {
    // Add conditional-dependent text to the output string
    myOutputValue = myOutputValue + 'Computer wins.';
    // Else if computer card rank is less than player card rank, player wins
  } else if (computerCard.rank < playerCard.rank) {
    myOutputValue = myOutputValue + 'Player wins!';
    // Otherwise (i.e. ranks are equal), it's a tie
  } else {
    myOutputValue = myOutputValue + "It's a tie.";
  }

  // Return the fully-constructed output string
  return myOutputValue;
};
```

## Hard-Coded Card Deck

1 acceptable way to initialise a standard 52-card deck in our code is to hard-code it, i.e. manually specify each card and each of its attributes in code. Use this hard-coded deck for this module's exercises below.

```javascript
var deck = [
  {
    name: 'ace',
    suit: 'hearts',
    rank: 1,
  },
  {
    name: '2',
    suit: 'hearts',
    rank: 2,
  },
  {
    name: '3',
    suit: 'hearts',
    rank: 3,
  },
  {
    name: '4',
    suit: 'hearts',
    rank: 4,
  },
  {
    name: '5',
    suit: 'hearts',
    rank: 5,
  },
  {
    name: '6',
    suit: 'hearts',
    rank: 6,
  },
  {
    name: '7',
    suit: 'hearts',
    rank: 7,
  },
  {
    name: '8',
    suit: 'hearts',
    rank: 8,
  },
  {
    name: '9',
    suit: 'hearts',
    rank: 9,

## Exercises

### Follow Along

Implement the High Card code above to get a working High Card game.

### Highest of 2 Cards

Change the High Card program so that the player and computer each draw 2 cards instead of 1. The player with the highest of any of the cards wins.
