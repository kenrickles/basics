# 10.3: Card Game Example: War

## Introduction

We implemented the card game [War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_%28card_game%29) as an example of how to think about the logic of a program and the step-by-step process of how to build the different parts.

## Exercise

1. Read the [Wikipedia page for War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_%28card_game%29) and write pseudocode for this game.
2. Start implementing the game as if you were to build the game from scratch. How would you implement this game and in what order would you implement it? If you would like, clone the [starter code](https://github.com/rocketacademy/swe101-starter-code) to work out ideas. 
3. After you've decided how you would implement the game and in what order you would implement it, begin the videos and see how RA's strategy is similar or different to yours.

## Part 1

In this video I dissect the pseudo code for the game and implement a simple version.

## Part 2

In this video I implement the war mode of the game when the players have the same card.

I run into a JavaScript error that tells me something new about how I wrote my code.

## Part 3

After finishing a version of the war mode condition and running into an error, in this video I work into the error and figure out how to solve it and some other issues that come up in the logic of my game.

I analyze the errors I get and the behaviour to work backwards to fill in the missing game logic, and I use fake data to confirm that my logic works.

## Part 4

I know that the logic I've constructed so far is sound and error free.

I still have an issue of not moving the cards around so I implement that for the war mode, then backtrack to make sure it works for the rest of the game.

## New Syntax

### Splice

Removes a part of an array and returns it from the function. See more about splice [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/splice).

```javascript
var list = [2, 4, 6, 99, 999, 9999];
var halfArray = list.splice(0, 3); // take 3 elements starting from zero
console.log(halfArray); // [2,4,6]
```

## Sample Solution

```javascript
var makeDeck = function () {
  // create the empty deck at the beginning
  var deck = [];

  var suits = ['hearts', 'diamonds', 'clubs', 'spades'];

  var suitIndex = 0;
  while (suitIndex < suits.length) {
    // make a variable of the current suit
    var currentSuit = suits[suitIndex];
    console.log('current suit : ' + currentSuit);

    // loop to create all cards in this suit
    // rank 1-13
    var rankCounter = 1;
    while (rankCounter <= 13) {
      var cardName = rankCounter;

      // 1, 11, 12 ,13
      if (cardName == 1) {
        cardName = 'ace';
      } else if (cardName == 11) {
        cardName = 'jack';
      } else if (cardName == 12) {
        cardName = 'queen';
      } else if (cardName == 13) {
        cardName = 'king';
      }

      // make a single card object variable
      var card = {
        name: cardName,
        suit: currentSuit,
        rank: rankCounter,
      };

      console.log('rank : ' + rankCounter);

      // add the card to the deck
      deck.push(card);

      rankCounter = rankCounter + 1;
    }
    suitIndex = suitIndex + 1;
  }

  return deck;
};

var addArray = function (fromArray, toArray) {
  var index = 0;
  while (index < fromArray.length) {
    toArray.unshift(fromArray[index]);
    index = index + 1;
  }
  return toArray;
};

var getRandomIndex = function (size) {
  return Math.floor(Math.random() * size);
};

var shuffleCards = function (cards) {
  var index = 0;

  while (index < cards.length) {
    var randomIndex = getRandomIndex(cards.length);

    var currentItem = cards[index];

    var randomItem = cards[randomIndex];

    cards[index] = randomItem;
    cards[randomIndex] = currentItem;

    index = index + 1;
  }

  return cards;
};

// create the cards for the beginning of the game

var deck = shuffleCards(makeDeck());

// the deck is suffled and split evenly among the players
var playerHand = deck.splice(0, 26);
var computerHand = deck;

## Post Mortem

There are a few different ways that building a game like this may be approached.

Another valid order to build the parts would have been to distribute the cards earlier before working out all the logic.

This might vary depending on how complicated the game was or how simple / complicated the logic was- if the logic for the game was any more complicated I might not wait til the end to implement an \*action\* in the game like distributing the cards.

I could have also decided to implement each drawing of the war cards as a new turn of the game- a running of the main function / clicking of the submit button. In that case I would have set a global variable with the game mode as "war".

In a more complex project it is also common that I attempt one approach and finally decide on another, if I begin to feel like it needs to be built in a certain order or that it will be easier another way.
