# 10.3: Card Game Example: War

## Introduction

We implemented the card game [War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_%28card_game%29) as an example of how to think about the logic of a program and the step-by-step process of how to build the different parts.

## Exercise

1. Read the [Wikipedia page for War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_%28card_game%29) and write pseudocode for this game.
2. Start implementing the game as if you were to build the game from scratch. How would you implement this game and in what order would you implement it? If you would like, clone the [starter code](https://github.com/rocketacademy/swe101-starter-code) to work out ideas. 
3. After you've decided how you would implement the game and in what order you would implement it, begin the videos and see how RA's strategy is similar to or different from yours.

## Part 1: Pseudocode

In this video we dissect the game pseudo-code and implement a simple version.

## Part 2: War Mode

In this video we implement War Mode when both players have the same card. We run into a JavaScript error that tells us something new about our code.

## Part 3: Debugging

After finishing War Mode and discovering an error in Part 2, we now triage the error, decide how to solve it, and resolve other logic issues. To triage the error we analyse the error text and program behaviour, working backward to fix game logic. Along the way we use fake data to test our logic to avoid long iteration cycles of testing via playing the whole game.

## Part 4: Testing

We have so far determined the logic we've constructed so far is sound and bug-free. We still haven't implemented moving cards to and from player hands, so we implement that for War Mode, then test our implementation and verify the rest of the game works.

## New Syntax

### Splice

The JS array `splice` method removes and returns a subset of an array as a new array. Read `splice` documentation [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/splice).

```javascript
var fullArray = [2, 4, 6, 99, 999, 9999];
// Remove elements from index 0 (inclusive) to 3 (exclusive) in fullArray
// and return them in a new array. halfArray stores the new array.
var halfArray = fullArray.splice(0, 3);
// halfArray contains [2, 4, 6]
console.log(halfArray);
```

### Unshift

The JS array `unshift` method adds an element to the start of an array. Read `unshift` documentation [here](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_unshift.asp#:~:text=The%20unshift%28%29%20method%20adds,use%20the%20push%28%29%20method.).

## Sample Solution

The following is the sample solution from the videos with slight edits for clarity.

```javascript
/**
 * Add all elements from fromArray to the start of toArray.
 */
var addArray = function (fromArray, toArray) {
  for (var i = 0; i < fromArray.length; i += 1) {
    // Add each element in fromArray to toArray individually
    toArray.unshift(fromArray[i]);  
  }
  return toArray;
};

/**
 * Create a standard 52-card deck
 */
var makeDeck = function () {
  // Initialise an empty deck array
  var cardDeck = [];
  // Initialise an array of the 4 suits in our deck. We will loop over this array.
  var suits = ['hearts', 'diamonds', 'clubs', 'spades'];
  
  // Loop over the suits array
  for (var suitIndex = 0; suitIndex < suits.length; suits += 1) {
    // Store the current suit in a variable
    var currentSuit = suits[suitIndex];
    
    // Loop from 1 to 13 to create all cards for a given suit
    // Notice rankCounter starts at 1 and not 0, and ends at 13 and not 12.
    // This is an example of a loop without an array.
    for (var rankCounter = 1; rankCounter <= 13; rankCounter += 1) {
      // By default, the card name is the same as rankCounter
      var cardName = rankCounter;
  
      // If rank is 1, 11, 12, or 13, set cardName to the ace or face card's name
      if (cardName == 1) {
        cardName = 'ace';
      } else if (cardName == 11) {
        cardName = 'jack';
      } else if (cardName == 12) {
        cardName = 'queen';
      } else if (cardName == 13) {
        cardName = 'king';
      }

      // Create a new card with the current name, suit, and rank
      var card = {
        name: cardName,
        suit: currentSuit,
        rank: rankCounter,
      };

      // Add the new card to the deck
      cardDeck.push(card);
    }
  }
  
  // Return the completed card deck
  return cardDeck;
};

/**
 * Get a random index ranging from 0 (inclusive) to max (exclusive).
 */
var getRandomIndex = function (max) {
  return Math.floor(Math.random() * max);
};

/**
 * Shuffle elements in the cardDeck array. Return the shuffled deck.
 */
var shuffleCards = function (cardDeck) {
  // Loop over the card deck array once
  for (var currentIndex = 0; currentIndex < cardDeck.length; currentIndex += 1) {
    // Select a random index in the deck
    var randomIndex = getRandomIndex(cardDeck.length);
    // Select the card that corresponds to randomIndex
    var randomCard = cardDeck[randomIndex];
    // Select the card that corresponds to currentIndex
    var currentCard = cardDeck[currentIndex];
    // Swap positions of randomCard and currentCard in the deck
    cardDeck[currentIndex] = randomCard;
    cardDeck[randomIndex] = currentCard;
  }
  // Return the shuffled deck
  return cardDeck;
};

// Initialise the shuffled card deck before the game starts.
var deck = shuffleCards(makeDeck());

// the deck is suffled and split evenly among the players
var playerHand = deck.splice(0, 26);
var computerHand = deck;

## Post Mortem

There are a few different ways that building a game like this may be approached.

Another valid order to build the parts would have been to distribute the cards earlier before working out all the logic.

This might vary depending on how complicated the game was or how simple / complicated the logic was- if the logic for the game was any more complicated I might not wait til the end to implement an \*action\* in the game like distributing the cards.

I could have also decided to implement each drawing of the war cards as a new turn of the game- a running of the main function / clicking of the submit button. In that case I would have set a global variable with the game mode as "war".

In a more complex project it is also common that I attempt one approach and finally decide on another, if I begin to feel like it needs to be built in a certain order or that it will be easier another way.
