Note that if for any reason you changed around any of the file structure of the repo this may not work correctly right away. `index.html` needs to be at the root of the repository.
{% endhint %}

## Sharing

The cloned BlackJack repo has built-in sharing code. When you share your project with friends on major platforms it will have a nice looking share image.

### Setting the Share Link

Edit the index.html to match the GitHub Pages URL you created in the instructions above.

To have your share link properly link to your page, find your GitHub Pages URL:

Replace the url in the URL section of the meta tags in index.html:

Facebook Share URL: line [30](https://github.com/rocketacademy/basics-blackjack/blob/main/index.html#L30)

```text
<meta property="og:url" content="<PUT YOUR URL HERE>index.html">
```

Twitter Share URL: line [37](https://github.com/rocketacademy/basics-blackjack/blob/main/index.html#L37)

```text
<meta name="twitter:url" content="<PUT YOUR URL HERE>index.html">
```

#### Sharing text: Put your name and some fun text in the share!

For Facebook / Slack / Whatsapp Shares: edit lines [31 & 32](https://github.com/rocketacademy/basics-blackjack/blob/main/index.html#L31-L32) in the index.html

```text
<meta property="og:title" content="YOURNAME's BlackJack Game!">
<meta property="og:description" content="A fun card game I made myself! ðŸ˜„ðŸ’ªðŸŒˆ">
```

For Twitter Shares: edit lines [38-42](https://github.com/rocketacademy/basics-blackjack/blob/main/index.html#L38-L42) in the index.html

```text
<meta name="twitter:title" content="YOURNAME's BlackJack Game!">
<meta name="twitter:description" content="A fun card game I made myself! ðŸ˜„ðŸ’ªðŸŒˆ">
<meta name="twitter:image" content="https://ra-web-files.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/basics/basics-blackjack-share-small.jpeg">
