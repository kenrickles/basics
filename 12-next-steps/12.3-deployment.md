Note that if for any reason you changed around any of the file structure of the repo this may not work correctly right away. `index.html` needs to be at the root of the repository.

## Sharing

The cloned BlackJack repo has built-in sharing code. When you share your project with friends on major platforms it will have a nice looking share image.

### Setting the Share Link

Edit lines 30 and 37 in the index.html to match the GitHub Pages URL you created in the instructions above.

### Customising Share Text

It's possible to customise the share text by changing some code in the index.html file.

Specifically the text on lines: [24](https://github.com/rocketacademy/basics-blackjack/blob/main/index.html#L24), [25](https://github.com/rocketacademy/basics-blackjack/blob/main/index.html#L25), [26](https://github.com/rocketacademy/basics-blackjack/blob/main/index.html#L26), [31](https://github.com/rocketacademy/basics-blackjack/blob/main/index.html#L31), [32](https://github.com/rocketacademy/basics-blackjack/blob/main/index.html#L32), [38](https://github.com/rocketacademy/basics-blackjack/blob/main/index.html#L38), [39](https://github.com/rocketacademy/basics-blackjack/blob/main/index.html#L39) and [42](https://github.com/rocketacademy/basics-blackjack/blob/main/index.html#L42). Your text will appear in the shared preview.
