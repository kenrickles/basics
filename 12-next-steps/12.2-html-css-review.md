# 10.1: HTML, CSS Referencing

## Why HTML

HTML pages and the software that transfers them are the foundation of the browser-based internet. A browser's fundamental task is to display HTML documents and handle built-in HTML behaviours.

### What is HTML

This is a brief overview of HTML5 and how to use it. This intro will cover basic tags, classes and IDs. It is important to understand what HTML is and how it is used in browsers. All browsers have an HTML engine built in that can read and interpret the syntax in an HTML file. The tags tell the browser what type of elements are on the page and also how those elements relate to each other. Just like an editor would mark up content of an article, a programmer can mark up a web page by using tags and attributes. The first thing to learn is the proper syntax of a basic HTML page. HTML uses tags wrapped around content to control the flow and look. For example, a paragraph tag is used to surround the text of the paragraph and let the browser know that it is a paragraph. The browser then applies its default styling to the paragraph. The paragraph tag looks like this:

```html
<p>Text of the paragraph</p>
```

the p is called the opening tag and the /p is called the closing tag. Both must be included to tell the browser where the paragraph begins and ends. What is written between the tags is displayed on the browser page, not the tags. Most tags have an opening and closing tag with the content in between. Tags are generally nested inside each other to maintain structure and flow of content.

### Intro To CSS

In the beginning was html and only html. But programmers wanted to add styling to their web pages to help distinguish themselves from others on the web. Initially, the answer was no. But in October 1994, Håkon Wium Lie introduced Cascading Style Sheets to the world. Today it is better known as CSS.

Built on top of HTML to add more visual control and complexity, CSS specifies styles on an HTML element or set of elements. The CSS code specifies visual properties unrelated to the written content on an HTML page. In practice there are 2 uses for CSS: element styling and layout.

#### Element Styling&#x20;

CSS helps us change visual properties of HTML elements, such as fonts, background images, or rounded corners on buttons. Together with JS DOM manipulation, we can use CSS to implement visual logic within an application, such as hiding or showing cards and flipping elements 90 degrees.&#x20;

#### Layout&#x20;

CSS can help us divide our UI into visual sections. This is one of the most tricky aspects of CSS, because CSS was not originally intended for layout design. CSS content in RA's Bootcamp will focus on implementing UI layouts.

CSS is a declarative language. It doesn't tell the browser what to do but rather describes the rules that the browser then uses to render the page. CSS became popular because it was predictable and forgiving in its syntax. It was also easy to learn.\
The concept of cascading styles is unique to CSS. To cascade means that styles can inherit and overwrite styles through its hierarchy called specificity. More on that in section 2. This concept also allowed for many style sheets to be applied to one page. That is what made CSS so popular.

As a declarative language, CSS uses selectors and declarations to apply styling rules to HTML pages. The syntax for CSS starts with a selector which tells the browser the rules for styling the selected elements. Then a declaration code block is created using open and closing curly braces. Inside the declaration code block rules are created. A rule is made up of a property name followed by a colon and then the value of the property followed by a semi-colon. You can have as many rules as needed. It is the standard to put each rule on its own line in code. The semi-colon tells the browser that the end of the line is reached so be sure to add it at the end of every rule.

#### Sample Syntax

```css
selector{
	property: value;
	property: value;
}
```

In Basics, you will apply CSS styling in two ways:

1. in-line
2. internal

#### In-Line Styling

**In-line styling** is written inside the HTML opening tag as an attribute-value pair. Like this:

```html
<p style=“color: red;”> This text would be red </p>

```

If more than one style declaration is applied:

```html
<p style=“color: red; font-weight: bold;”> This text is red and bold</p>

```

#### Internal Styling

**Internal styling** is placed inside the head tag of the page and is wrapped inside the style tag. In this example, the selector of p is chosen to style all the paragraph tags on the page.

```html
<html>
   <head>
      <title> Page Title </title>
         <style>
            p{			
               color: white;
            }
         </style>
   </head>
   <body>
	<p> This text is white </p>
   </body>
</html>
```

You will be using internal styling in your exercises.  **Don't forget to put your CSS declarations between style tags.**

## Introduction

We've completed the basics of how to code with JavaScript. Our hope is that you have some idea of how a program goes from conception to working code.

Above is only an introduction to HTML and CSS. HTML and CSS are **not** programming languages, and are used for formatting, layout, and styling the elements that are displayed by the browser. However, we may want to apply the programming logic we have learnt to manipulate and change what is displayed on the browser.&#x20;

In [10.2: Browser Application with DOM](12.1-browser-applications-with-dom.md), we will learn how to make our web applications more interactive by using JavaScript _logic_ to change the previously-static elements that are rendered by the browser. We can effectively write programs that change what the user sees. We can tell the browser _"_[_change the background color of this element when the submit button is clicked_](https://rocketacademy.github.io/basics-starter-code/dom/colours/index.html)_"_ or _"disable this button if the user runs out of money"_ or, if you are feeling nefarious, _"make this pop-up appear"_.

In order to do that, we must first be able to _reference_ HTML elements that have already been rendered and link them to JavaScript variables, so that we can manipulate them the same way we manipulated data previously.

## Referencing HTML elements

We'll review two basic ways to reference an HTML element: by their class or their ID.

When defining HTML elements in `index.html`, we can initially assign them an ID or a class. IDs are unique, and should not be applied to multiple elements (just like your ID number), but multiple HTML elements can share classes, and HTML elements can belong to multiple classes. Not all HTML elements need to have an ID or a class.

## Classes

Classes are used in CSS when a programmer wants the same set of rules to apply to many elements at once. Rather than write the rules for each element in the style sheet, a class can simply be applied.  A class is written as an attribute-value pair inside the opening tag of an element.&#x20;

```
<h2 class="special">This h2 has a class of special </h2>
<p class="special" > This paragraph has a class of special </p>
```

Here is the CSS code for the _special_ class (note that in css a class is denoted with a period (.) before the name of the class:

```
.special{
    background-color: green;
    color: white:
    }
```

The h2 and the p tag text would have a background-color of green and text color of white.

More than one class can be applied to an element and more than one element can apply a class.

```markup
// This is the HTML File

<p class="card face-down">ace of spades</p>
<p class="card face-up">ace of clubs</p>
```

This CSS grabs these elements and applies these styles.

```css
// This is the CSS file

.card {
  background-color: pink;
}

.face-up {
  font-size: 20px;
}

.page-link {
  font: 'comic-sans';
}
```

## IDs

An ID used on one and only one element.  Just like each person has their own driver's license or  membership number unique to them, an ID should be unique.  An ID is written as an attribute-value pair inside the opening tag of an element:

```
<p> This is a regular p tag </p>
<p id="unique" > This paragraph is unique in its styling </p>
```

This is how to write an ID in CSS (notice that an ID is denoted with a hash or pound sign (#) before the name of the ID:

```
#unique{
    color: green;
    font-size: 25px;
    }
```

The font size of the paragraph with id "unique" will be 25px and its text will be color green.&#x20;

As stated before, only one ID can be applied to an element, though if you break this rule you won't get any errors, maybe just some unintended behaviours. An element can have both an ID and a class, or multiple classes..

```markup
<p id="player-card-one" class="card face-up">ace of spades</p>
```

This CSS grabs the paragraph with the player-card-one ID above and applies the style rules that create a solid red border that is 3px wide.

```css
#player-card-one {
  border: 3px solid red;
}
```

## Basics Starter Code

Take a look at `index.html` from the basics-starter-code. Read through lines 62 to 74, and notice that some HTML elements have ids associated with them. Lines 81-99 reference some of these HTML elements, and defines the logic that has been associating the Submit button and input/output fields to the main function. We will now take a closer look at the syntax and concepts that make this work.
