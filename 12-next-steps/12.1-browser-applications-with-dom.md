# 12.1: Browser Applications with DOM

We've completed the basics of how to code with JavaScript.

Our hope is that you have some idea of how a program goes from conception to working code.

Now we'll describe more about the environment we've been working with in the browser.

{% hint style="warning" %}
This section is meant as a crash course on the rest of the browser system.

Don't worry if it seems like a lot of content, as it covers what would be enough for a whole other course.

Here we can distinguish between **domain knowledge** -technical knowledge of a specific system, and general programming knowledge, which we've been focusing on during this course.

For a different kind of system \(a back-end web system, for example, or a mobile device system\) we would just have to define a different system of inputs and outputs. The middle section of our program, the equivalent `main` function would still need to do the same actions.

This level of functionality simply expands the set of tools you have to represent things in your app.

A hand of cards can be represented by a `div` that contains a set of images. Or by a `li` \(list\) element.

Getting a hold of user actions for a given point in the program can mean many different things.

Hit or stand can mean your program creates a button to be clicked for that given "mode".

## Advanced Applications in the Browser

The pattern of being able to create any representation of data on the screen and to have complete control over what actions the user can take at any time basically means that your app should have complete control over every element on the screen at a given time and control what kind of input can be gotten from those elements.

Modern development for applications that run in the browser \( the browser is the front-end \) are libraries and frameworks that allow programmers to manage all of these elements and inputs.

The code that gets written is less focused on which elements are created and tied to which user actions, and more about the logic of the actions and elements. \(Three of a kind beats two of a kind, when one hand beats another, display a winning state banner, etc.\)

Some popular libraries include [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/), [Angular](https://angular.io/) and [Vue](https://vuejs.org/).

### Grab Any Element

To review how element selection works, see the simple examples [on this page.](12.2-html-css-review.md)

Look up how to get a reference to any element: [https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met\_document\_queryselector.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_document_queryselector.asp)

### Get Any Input

Look up how to "listen" for any event: [https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met\_document\_addeventlistener.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_document_addeventlistener.asp)

You will also see this syntax:

```javascript
button.addEventListener('click', function () {
  console.log('clicked');
});
```

This syntax sets the function without making a separate variable out of it.

### Make Any Output

Create an element: [https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met\_document\_createelement.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_document_createelement.asp)

Add it to the page with `appendChild`: [https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met\_node\_appendchild.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_node_appendchild.asp)

## Starter Code

The DOM manipulation code in the starter code is inside the `index.html`.

Read through the comments to see what's actually happening.

```markup
<p>
    <input id="starter-ex"/>
</p>
<button id="starter-button">submit me</button>
```

```javascript
// make a variable out of the input and button
var input = document.querySelector('#starter-ex');
var button = document.querySelector('#starter-button');

// call this function
var myButtonClicked = function () {
  // get the current value that's been typed into the input
  var typedValue = input.value;

  // create a new h2
  var newHtwo = document.createElement('h2');

  // set the text inside this new element
  newHtwo.innerText = typedValue;

  // make the h2 appear on screen
  document.body.appendChild(newHtwo);

  // empty out the HTML input
  input.value = '';
};

// say which function to call *when* the user clicks the button
button.addEventListener('click', myButtonClicked);
```
