# 12.1 Browser Applications with DOM

We've completed the basics of how to code with JavaScript.

Our hope is that you have some idea of how a program goes from conception to working code.

Now we'll describe more about the environment we've been working with in the browser.

## Inputs and Outputs

The browser is an application that deals with HTML code. This HTML code gives basic instructions about what kind of thing to display on the page.

HTML differs from JavaScript in that HTML has no logic, no control flow and doesn't hold data. It simply describes the way a set of content should be displayed.

In the end the task of JavaScript is to use this environment of HTML displaying functionality to give the users tools \([affordance ](https://uxplanet.org/ux-design-glossary-how-to-use-affordances-in-user-interfaces-393c8e9686e4)in UX language\) to give input to the program, and components to display the output of the program.

We have purposely described inputs and outputs very narrowly, but the next step in understanding what a real front-end application does and is capable of, is to begin to describe all of the different kinds of inputs that can be given to the program, and all the different outputs that can be generated.

**Our javascript is capable of taking as input:**

* Any user mouse movement within the browser screen.
* Any element on the page they've clicked on.
* Any radio button, drop down or checkbox they've interacted with.
* And more....

**Out JavaScript is capable of giving output as:**

* Any HTML element, with any CSS style applied to it. 

The power of JavaScript is that our program can take in and control anything the user does in a browser page.

## DOM - Document Object Model

DOM is the name of the set of JavaScript variables that represent everything within the browser.

We've already seen one: `console.log`. Otherwise you could write a program that, for example, calculates prime numbers, or the places in Pi and it doesn't have to otherwise interact with the browser itself, or even give any output!

When we want our JavaScript to take in any inputs or give any outputs we have to use some part of the DOM functionality.

Besides `console.log` \(specifically `console`\), the other major variables that represent the DOM are `window` and `document`.

DOM is also referred to as an API - an Application Programming Interface - the interface or representation of everything that happens in the browser screen. 

In this case interface refers to the fact that JavaScript does not literally know about everything that happens in the browser screen, \(e.g., when you bring up the Mac or Windows right click menus\), just the subset of things that Chrome allows us to interface with.  


{% hint style="info" %}
Open the console and type in the variable names window and document to see the values in the console.

Click the triangles to see inside them.

What is there?
{% endhint %}

## HTML Elements as JavaScript Variables

Using the DOM we can create a JavaScript representation of an element that's on the screen.

Given this element:

```markup
<p id="wow">cool :)</p>
```

We can create a variable that "grabs" it from the DOM.

```javascript
var wowParagraph = document.querySelector('#wow');
```

## Defining an Input

An input to our JavaScript program is called an event. All this means is that we can set the browser in such a way that when the user makes an action, the browser calls our function - and this is exactly how our `main` function works. Except that we aren't just limited to clicking on the submit button or getting the value the user typed from an input.

```javascript
var myNewMain = function(event){
    console.log('hey wow my new function');
};

wowParagraph.addEventListener('click', myNewMain);
```

## Creating an Output

We can use the DOM to create elements and put them on the page.

```javascript
var coolParagraph = document.createElement('p');

coolParagraph.innerText = 'hey, cool!!!1!';
```

After we've created this element we need to tell the DOM to put it into the page.

```javascript
document.body.appendChild( coolParagraph );
```

## Grab Any Element

Look up how to get a reference to any element: [https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met\_document\_queryselector.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_document_queryselector.asp)

## Get Any Input

Look up how to "listen" for any event: [https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met\_document\_addeventlistener.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_document_addeventlistener.asp)

## Make Any Output

Create an element: [https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met\_document\_createelement.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_document_createelement.asp)

Add it to the page with `appendChild`: [https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met\_node\_appendchild.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_node_appendchild.asp)

## Starter Code

The DOM manipulation code in the starter code is inside the `index.html`.

```javascript
// call this function 
var buttonEventFunc = function () {

  // get the input element
  var input = document.querySelector('#my-input');
  
  // call main function, put in the value of the input
  var result = main(input.value);

  // get the grey box
  var output = document.querySelector('#output');
  
  // Display result in output element (grey box)
  output.innerHTML = result;

  // Reset input value
  input.value = "";
};

// get the submit button
var button = document.querySelector('#my-button');

// say which function to call *when* the user clicks the button
button.addEventListener('click', buttonEventFunc);
```
