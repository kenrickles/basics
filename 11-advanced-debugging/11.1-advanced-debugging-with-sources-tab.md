# 11.1 Advanced Debugging with Sources Tab

As your code become more complex `console.log`s may not be sufficient to understand what your code is doing or where your errors are coming from.

As always one of the fundamental goals in the process of building a program is to be able understand all it's states and values at each step.

You had some intuition or intention about what those states and values were when you wrote the program, but either it's hard to know exactly what they are at each point, or they diverge from what you thought they were. `console.log` allows you to examine the forensics of what the values were when the program ran.

The next level of debugging techniques and tools is the ability to be able to look at the values in your code _**\*as it is running\***_. To be able to press the pause button in the middle of the program and look around at everything and then click to play the program forward again.

## Sources Tab

The sources tab is where the debugging tools live. This tab has many features to it but we will just be covering the bare minimum of it's functionality.

You can refer to the official chrome dev tools guide here if you wish to dive further into the subject: [https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/javascript](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/javascript)
