### `console.log`

`console.log` should be the default way to try to understand your code. When it seems like you need more precision, or if a console won't be able to cover the breadth of data you need to look at, you can switch to debugger.

### Debugger

Debugger allows you to see into the code exactly when and where you want to. It gives you a level of insight that you can't get only with `console.log`.

## Exercises

### Drawing App Debugging

Open your drawing game and set a breakpoint inside the loop. Open the console to inspect the values at that point. Advance the debugger to see the values as the loop continues.

Use `git clone` to get a copy of [Kai's reference solution for the drawing app. ](https://github.com/kai-rocket/basics-drawing)Open it in the browser and set a breakpoint inside the inner loop. Open the console to inspect the values at that point. Advance the debugger to see the values as the loop continues.
