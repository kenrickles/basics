A GitHub "[**pull request**](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)" \(PR\) is a request to pull changes from 1 repo on GitHub to another. PRs are most commonly used as a code-review mechanism, where developers submit PRs for review before merging the code in those PRs to their company's shared repo. We will use PRs in Coding Basics to submit projects.

When we've pushed our changes to our repo, we'll click the "Pull requests" button to create a new pull request.

## Cheatsheet

Here is the workflow for Coding Basics projects:

1. Go to the project repo page. Click the "Fork" button to copy the repo to your own GitHub account.
2. On your computer in the command line, **clone the repo from your own Github account's copy of the repo.**
3. Once the repo is on your computer, follow the Git workflow and cheatsheet [here](../2-organising-and-managing-code-files/2.2-git.md#cheat-sheet).
4. `git push` your changes to your repo. Refresh the repo page to see your commits on the repo.
5. Create a pull request in GitHub. This connects your work on the repo _in your account_ to the original Rocket Academy repo. Fill in the survey and submit.
