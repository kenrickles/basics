# Day 11: Blackjack Redux, Debugger

## Peer-Led Code Review \(with Debugger\)

Review your partner's code as per [Peer-Led Code Review instructions](../course-logistics/course-methodology.md#peer-led-code-review). Complete the [Debugger section](day-11-blackjack-redux-debugger.md#debugger) below before implementing features. Once both have a working game, work on [More Comfortable](day-11-blackjack-redux-debugger.md#more-comfortable) on one person's code.

## Debugger

Practice using the debugger on the game. Please switch driver so that each person gets a chance to set the debugger on their own computer.

### Someone Else's Code

Use the debugger to see into the code.

1. Create `console.log`s before and after where the cards are swapped in the shuffle function. Set the breakpoints on the `console.log`s.
2. If the code is using the deck generation function, set a breakpoint in the code where it pushes the individual card object into the deck array.

### Your Own Code

Switch to use the debugger on your own code.

1. Set a breakpoint inside the main part of the game when the cards are being dealt.
2. If you have an error, set a breakpoint to investigate the error.

## More Comfortable

Implement [More Comfortable exercises](../projects/project-3-blackjack.md#more-comfortable) in the project writeup. Once done, push your code to update your pull request in GitHub.
