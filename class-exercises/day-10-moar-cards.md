# Day 10: Moar Cards

![](../.gitbook/assets/images-ccad.jpeg)

Begin by cloning a new copy of the [starter code.](https://github.com/rocketacademy/swe101-starter-code) Reminder to `npm install` to activate ESLint!

Copy the deck array and the card shuffle function from the [objects page](https://swe101.rocketacademy.co/10-javascript-objects/10-1-objects).

## Display a single card

When the user clicks submit draw a single card from the deck and show it to them.

## High Card

Implement the High Card game from [10.1: Objects](../10-javascript-objects/10-1-objects.md#high-card) without copying the code.

## Hands

At the beginning of the game the player can say how many cards they want. The highest card the player has is what's compared against the computer card.  

## **Wild**

At the beginning of the game, pick a random card in the deck that the player will always win the game with. \(No ties\).

## Hands 2

At the beginning of the game the player can say how many cards they want. For each turn they say which card in their hand they want to play. 

## Wild - Player's Choice

At the beginning of the game ask the player to name a single card that will win the game no matter what.  \(No ties\).

## **Bets**

Allow the player to wager a number of points on each game. \(A new mode will be needed for the beginning of the game where the player selects the number of points to wager\). They lose the points if they lose or a draw, and double them if they win. The player begins with 100 points.

## Two-Player

Add another mode so that the game can be played by 2 players taking turns playing a card from their hand. The grey box will tell the players to switch so they don't see each other's cards.
