# Day 5: Scissors Paper Stone Redux

## Peer-Led Code Review

Review your partner's code as per [Peer-Led Code Review instructions](../course-logistics/course-methodology.md#peer-led-code-review). Once both have a working game, implement any of the following features together on one person's code.

## SPS Reverse Game Mode

You decide to prank your friends and create an SPS game mode where the rules are reversed: scissors beat stone, stone beats paper, and paper beats scissors. Create a game mode where if a user types in "reverse", it reverses the SPS rules. Once done, push your code and update your pull request in GitHub.

## More Comfortable

Implement the [More Comfortable exercises](../projects/project-1-scissors-paper-stone.md#more-comfortable) that were optional in the project writeup. Once done, push your code and update your pull request in GitHub.
