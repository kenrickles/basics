# Day 5: Scissors Paper Stone Redux

## Code Review

1. Take turns to review each others' SPS project code. You can do this by sharing the pull request links with each other and leaving comments on each others' pull requests.
2. Make the relevant changes suggested by your partner, commit your changes, and update the relevant pull requests.
3. Call your section leader over to review once you're done!

## SPS Reverse Game Mode

You decide to prank your friends and create an SPS game mode where the rules are reversed: scissors beat stone, stone beats paper, and paper beats scissors. Create a game mode where if a user types in "reverse", it reverses the SPS rules. Once done, push your code and update your pull request in GitHub.

## Korean Scissors Paper Stone

Implement the [Korean version of Scissors Paper Stone](../projects/project-1-scissors-paper-stone.md#optional-korean-scissors-paper-stone) that was optional in the project writeup. Once done, push your code and update your pull request in GitHub.
