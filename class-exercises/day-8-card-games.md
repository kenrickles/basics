# Day 8: Card Games

![](../.gitbook/assets/deckofcards_cover-02.png)

Begin by cloning a new copy of the [starter code.](https://github.com/rocketacademy/swe101-starter-code) Reminder to `npm install` to activate ESLint!

Copy the deck array and the card shuffle function from the [objects page](https://swe101.rocketacademy.co/10-javascript-objects/10-1-objects).

## Display a single card

When the user clicks submit draw a single card from the deck and show it to them.

## High Card

Implement the high card game from the GitBook

## Best Hand

Draw 6 cards for the player and the computer. The player with the most pairs wins. Let the player know if it was a tie or if someone won.

Change the program so the player can select the number of cards dealt.

## **Bets**

Allow the player to wager a number of points on each game. \(A new mode will be needed for the beginning of the game where the player selects the number of points to wager\). They lose the points if they lose or a draw, and double them if they win. The player begins with 100 points.

## Two-Player

Add another mode so that the game can be played by 2 players taking turns. The grey box will tell the players to switch so they don't see each other's cards.

## n-of-a-kind

Detect if the player has a three of a kind or four of a kind.

## Multi-Player

Add another mode so that the game can be played by multiple players taking turns. At the very beginning of the game, ask how many players would like to play.
