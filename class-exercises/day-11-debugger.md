# Day 11: Debugger

## Debugger

Practice using the debugger on sample code and real problems.

### Someone Else's Code

Part 1

Begin by cloning Kai's [solution repo for drawing.](https://github.com/kai-rocket/swe101-drawing)

Open up the code in the editor.

Change the code so that it runs "center square"- you have to change[ line 171](https://github.com/kai-rocket/swe101-drawing/blob/master/script.js#L171) so the function name is `main`.

Spend a few minutes to read the code and understand how it works.

Run the code so you can see that it works.

Now we'll use the debugger to see into the code.

Set a breakpoint for[ line 186](https://github.com/kai-rocket/swe101-drawing/blob/master/script.js#L186). 

Enter the number 9 into the input and click the submit button.

On the 6th iteration of the loop write down what the individual boolean values are for each boolean statement. \(i.e `outerCounter == 0` and `outerCounter == sideLength - 1` and`innerCounter == 0`  , etc.\) 

#### Part 2

Do the same for [the rings code.](https://github.com/kai-rocket/swe101-drawing/blob/master/script.js#L209) See if you can use the debugger to help you figure out what the code is doing. \(If you just use it to see the values, it won't help you understand unless you are building a model of how it runs\). 

### Your Own Code

Use the debugger on your drawing code inside the loop.

Set a breakpoint at the same place, one that has a conditional statement inside a loop.

Look to see all the values.

Switch with your partner to look at their code.

## BlackJack

Choose one person's Blackjack card game to work on. If applicable chose the person who has been working on a bug in their game.

If possible, use the debugger to investigate the error.
