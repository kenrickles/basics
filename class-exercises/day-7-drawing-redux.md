# Day 7: Loops and Arrays

### Mad Libs

If you're unfamiliar with the game MadLibs, take a look here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad\_Libs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs)

Come up with your Mad Lib. If you don't want to create anything, you can use the default one from the Wikipedia page:

```text
"___________! he said ________ as he jumped into his convertible ______ and drove off with his _________ wife."
 exclamation           adverb                                     noun                         adjective                                                   
```

Hard code the exclamation, adverb and noun, but leave 1 adjective blank. In the Wikipedia sentence, the adjective is at the end of the sentence.

At the beginning of the app, ask the user to input a series of adjectives. We can choose to have the user input 1 adjective per input or multiple. Store these in an array.

When the user types "create" in the input, change the mode to complete your Mad Lib by randomly selecting an adjective from the array. Output the completed Mad Lib in the grey box.

### Mad Libs V2

Create a mode\(s\) to input words from each type, e.g. exclamation, adverb, noun, and adjective. For each type, prompt the user what type of word they should be entering.

### Popular Mad Libs

Keep track of which words are selected. Create a mode of the game that shows a Mad Lib using the set of words \(verb, adjective, etc.\) that are \(randomly\) selected the most often by the app. 

Add another mode that also shows the set of least selected words.

### Sets of Mad Libs

Create an array of Mad Lib sentences.

Example:

She asked {adverb} for the {noun} and when they were rude, she said {exclamation} and hung up the {adjective} phone.

When the user creates a random Mad Lib sentence have the app choose a random Mad Lib sentence and a set of words.
