# Day 7: Loops and Arrays

### Mad Libs

If you're unfamiliar with the game MadLibs, take a look here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad\_Libs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs)

Come up with your Mad Lib. If you don't want to create anything, you can use the default one from the wikipedia page:

```text
 "___________! he said ________ as he jumped into his convertible ______ and drove off with his _________ wife."
exclamation           adverb                                     noun                         adjective 
                                                     
```

Hard code the exclamation, adverb and noun.  
At the beginning of the app, ask the user to input just a series of adjectives. Store these in an array.

When the user types "create" in the input, change the mode to create a Mad Lib by randomly selecting an adjective from the array. Show it in the grey box.

### Mad Libs V2

Create a mode to input the words from each type. 

### Mad Libs V3

Create an array of sentences.

Example:

She asked {adverb} for the {noun} and when they were rude, she said {exclamation} {adjective} and hung up the phone.
