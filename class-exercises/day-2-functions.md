# Day 2: Functions

## Introduction

Today we will write functions to perform data transformations, similar to examples in [5.1: Functions](../5-structuring-and-debugging-code/5.1-functions.md#exercises). For each exercise, make a copy of the [starter code](https://github.com/rocketacademy/swe101-starter-code) as per instructions in [4.2: Our First Program](../4-getting-started-with-code/4.2-our-first-program.md#setup). Remember to `npm install` to activate ESLint! For some exercises you may need to google for information. Please switch driver and navigator each exercise.

{% hint style="warning" %}
When cloning the starter code, put each exercise in a separate folder, like the folder structure in [Required Hardware and Software](../course-logistics/required-hardware-and-software.md#folder-structure-for-swe101). This is to avoid Git repos inside Git repos, which can cause problems with Git.

## Air Conditioner

Your aircon uses 2 KW/h. Electricity is $0.20 a KW/h. The user can enter the number of hours they'll use their aircon for, and the app will tell them the cost.

## Screen Time

On [Android 10](https://wellbeing.google/tools/), [iOS 12](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208982), and later versions, we can see how many hours per day we spend on each app. Find the number of hours you spend per day on the app you use most. If you're not able to find this, you can google for common statistics.

Given the number of hours per day spent on your favourite app and the average life expectancy of 82 years in Singapore, create an app that renders how many days you will spend in your lifetime on this app. 

For example, if I spend 2 hours per day on WhatsApp and I live an average lifetime, how many days will I spend in my lifetime on WhatsApp?

## Singtel

You are creating an app for the $19.99 50GB post-paid plan. The user wants to know more about the cost of their plan. The user will enter how many GB they use per month, and the app will tell them how much they are paying per GB.

For example if the user only used 1GB this month, the app would calculate $19.99 per GB. If the user used 2GB this month the app would calculate $9.98 per GB.

## Ice Machine

The ice machine at your hotel can produce 120 pounds of ice a day. An average cube weighs 1.5 grams. The user will enter the number of guests at a hotel event. The app will calculate how long the hotel needs to run the machine to produce 2 drinks per guest, 4 cubes per drink.

## Beer Order

Create an app for a bar. The user will enter the average number of customers per day, and the app will estimate how many half-barrel-size kegs the bar needs per quarter. Assume an average customer drinks two pints per visit.

## Mortgage Calculator

Create a mortgage calculator for a bank. This bank is just starting so their loan terms are simple and the same for everyone. The amount is always the same: $100,000. The interest is 3% APR. The term is 10 years.

Output several values including:

1. How much the customer will pay back in total, including the principal.
2. How much the customer will pay just in interest.
3. How much the customer's monthly payment will be.
