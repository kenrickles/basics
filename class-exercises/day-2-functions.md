# Day 2: Functions

## Data Transformations with Functions

For each app, make a copy of the starter code, as in the [setup](https://swe101.rocketacademy.co/4-getting-started-with-code/4-2-our-first-program#setup) with `git clone`.

 Reminder to `npm install` to activate ESLint!

{% hint style="warning" %}
When cloning, put each app in a separate folder, like the folder structure in [Required Hardware and Software](../course-logistics/required-hardware-and-software.md#folder-structure-for-swe101). This is to avoid Git repos inside Git repos, which can cause problems with Git.
{% endhint %}

For some apps you may need to google things. Remember that as pairs, you are also googling together. 

**Please switch driver and navigator each app.**

### Air Conditioner

Your aircon uses 2 KW/h. Electricity is $0.20 a KW/h. The user can enter the number of hours they'll use their aircon for, and the app will tell them the cost. 

### Screen Time

You can find out how many hours per day you spend on each app on [Android 10](https://wellbeing.google/tools/)+ and [iOS 12](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208982)+. Given the average life expectancy of 82 years in Singapore, create an app that tells you how many days you will spend in your lifetime in the app you use the most. \(If you don't have this information about app usage you can look up some common statistics\).

For example, if I spend 2 hours per day on WhatsApp and I live an average lifetime, how many days will I spend in my lifetime on WhatsApp?

### Singtel

You are creating an app for the $19.99 50GB post paid plan. The user wants to know more about the cost of their plan. The user will enter how many GB they use per month, and the app will tell them how much they are paying per GB.

For example if the user only used 1GB this month, the app would calculate $19.99 per GB. If the user used 2GB this month the app would calculate $9.98 per GB. 

### Ice Machine

The ice machine at your hotel can produce 120 pounds of ice a day. An average cube weighs 1.5 grams. The user will enter the number of guests at a hotel event. The app will calculate how long the hotel needs to run the machine for 2 drinks per guest, 4 cubes per drink.

### Mortgage

Create a mortgage calculator for a bank. This bank is just starting out so their loan terms are simple and the same for everyone. The amount is always the same: $100,000. The interest is 3% APR. The term is 10 years.  
  
Output several values including:

* How much they will pay in total including the principal.
* How much the user will pay just in interest.
* How much their monthly payment will be.
