# Day 1: Basic File and Data Manipulation

## Introduction

Today's in-class exercise has 2 sections.

1. [File manipulation with command line and Git](day-1-basic-file-and-data-manipulation.md#file-manipulation-with-command-line-and-git)
2. [Data manipulation with operations and variables](day-1-basic-file-and-data-manipulation.md#data-manipulation-with-operations-and-variables)

## File Manipulation with Command Line and Git

You may wish to refer to the [command line cheatsheet](../2-organising-and-managing-code-files/2.1-command-line.md#cheat-sheet) and [Git cheatsheet](../2-organising-and-managing-code-files/2.2-git.md#cheat-sheet), and use [window snapping](../course-logistics/required-hardware-and-software.md#window-snapping-software) to position 3 windows on your screen simultaneously: VSCode, the relevant cheatsheet, and these instructions.

### Create a Haiku

We will create poetry, save and edit it using the command line and Git.

1. Open the command line and create a folder for your poetry.
2. Inside the folder, create a text file in the command line and open it in VSCode.
3. Write a haiku about trees and save the file. \(A haiku is a Japanese poem that follows the convention of 5 syllables 7 syllable 5 syllable\).
4. Create a Git repo in the folder and add and commit the poetry file.
5. Edit your poem to reference leaves. Make a commit for your changes.
6. Add a second poem about winter in another file. Commit this file to the repo.
7. Title your poem about trees. Add the title to the text in the file, and change the filename to reflect the title. Commit these changes.
8. Delete your poem about winter from the repo. \(Delete the file and commit the changes\).

**Hint:** At any time you can type the `tab` key and the command line will try to auto complete for you. This works for the names of commands and also long file or folder names.

## Data Manipulation with Operations and Variables

For each app, make a copy of the starter code, as in the [setup](https://swe101.rocketacademy.co/4-getting-started-with-code/4-2-our-first-program#setup) with `git clone`.

Reminder to `npm install` to activate ESLint!

For some apps you may need to google things. Remember that as pairs, you are also googling together. Please switch driver and navigator each app.

### **Minutes in a week**

The user will enter a number of weeks. Output the number of minutes in those weeks in the grey box.

Format the output nicely. Like: `In 3 weeks there are 4320 minutes! Wow!`

### **Temperatures 1**

The user enters a temperature in Fahrenheit. Output the conversion to Celsius in the grey box. Format the output nicely.

### **Buffet**

There's all you can eat ice cream at the buffet. The buffet receives the ice cream in 400ml containers.

To try to save money the buffet has restricted you to putting your ice cream in a tiny 70ml cup.

The user will enter a number of trips to the ice cream station \(picking up **1 cup** per trip\) and the app will calculate how many **containers** of ice cream you would consume. Showing this number of containers in decimal format is ok.

### **km/L**

A new Ferrari consumes 9km/litre. Petrol costs $2.20/litre. The user will enter a trip length in kilometres and the app will give a cost estimate.

### **Sonnets**

The user will enter their Words Per Minute typing speed. The app will calculate how long it will take them to type all of Shakespeare's sonnets in hours.
