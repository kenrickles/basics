# Day 1: Basic File and Data Manipulation

## Introduction

We will now put to use what we have learned so far. Before you attempt a problem, be sure to:

1. Read through the entire problem statement individually.
2. Check your understanding of the problem by **discussing with your partner**:
   1. What the program needs to do.
   2. How it can be implemented.
3. Write or type, in plain English, the instructions you and your partner want your program to follow.

For some problems you may need to google for information. Remember that as pairs, you are also googling together. **Please switch driver and navigator for each problem statement. **

When you run into a bug, talk out loud with your partner what you _expected_ to happen, and what happened instead, before attempting to find a solution. If needed, use the 'ask host for help' function in Zoom.

## Data Manipulation with Operations and Variables



### **Minutes in Weeks**

The user will enter a number of weeks. The program should output the number of minutes in those weeks in the output box.&#x20;

Format the output nicely. Like: `In 3 weeks there are 30240 minutes! Wow!`

### **Fahrenheit to Celsius**

The user enters a temperature in Fahrenheit. The program should output the conversion to Celsius in the output box.&#x20;

Format the output nicely.

### **Road Trip Cost**

The user will enter the length of a planned road trip in his brand new Ferrari. The program should output the estimated fuel cost of the road trip.

A new Ferrari consumes 9km/litre. Petrol costs $2.20/litre.

Format the output nicely.

### **Ice Cream Buffet**

There's all-you-can-eat ice cream at the buffet. The buffet receives ice cream in 400ml containers. To save money the buffet only provides 70ml cups for customers to get ice cream.

The user will enter a number of trips to the ice cream station (picking up **1 cup per trip**) and the app will calculate how many **containers** of ice cream you would consume. It is ok to show the number of containers in decimal format.

### **Time to Type Sonnets**

The user will enter their words-per-minute typing speed. The app will calculate how long it will take them to type all of Shakespeare's sonnets in hours. For simplicity, assume 17,677 words in all of Shakespeare's sonnets.



## Reference Solution

[Here](https://github.com/rocketacademy/basics-starter-code/blob/day1/script.js) is a reference solution for the Data Manipulation exercises above. Please only view the reference solution for each exercise after you have attempted the exercise yourself. Note that there are many ways to implement these solutions and the reference solution is only 1 way.
