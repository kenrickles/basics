# 10.2: HTML, CSS Referencing

## Introduction

In [10.3: Browser Application with DOM](10.3-browser-applications-with-dom.md), we will learn how to make our web applications more interactive by using JavaScript _logic_ to change the previously-static elements that are rendered by the browser. We can effectively write programs that change what the user sees. We can tell the browser _"_[_change the background color of this element when the submit button is clicked_](https://rocketacademy.github.io/basics-starter-code/dom/colours/index.html)_"_ or _"disable this button if the user runs out of money"_ or, if you are feeling nefarious, _"make this pop-up appear"_.

In order to do that, we must first be able to _reference_ HTML elements that have already been rendered and link them to JavaScript variables, so that we can manipulate them the same way we manipulated data previously.Referencing HTML elements

We'll review two basic ways to reference an HTML element: by their class or their ID.

When defining HTML elements in `index.html`, we can initially assign them an ID or a class. IDs are unique, and should not be applied to multiple elements (just like your ID number), but multiple HTML elements can share classes, and HTML elements can belong to multiple classes. Not all HTML elements need to have an ID or a class.

## Classes

Classes are used in CSS when a programmer wants the same set of rules to apply to many elements at once. Rather than write the rules for each element in the style sheet, a class can simply be applied.  A class is written as an attribute-value pair inside the opening tag of an element.&#x20;

```
<h2 class="special">This h2 has a class of special </h2>
<p class="special" > This paragraph has a class of special </p>
```

Here is the CSS code for the _special_ class (note that in css a class is denoted with a period (.) before the name of the class:

```
.special{
    background-color: green;
    color: white:
    }
```

The h2 and the p tag text would have a background-color of green and text color of white.

More than one class can be applied to an element and more than one element can apply a class.

```markup
// This is the HTML File

<p class="card face-down">ace of spades</p>
<p class="card face-up">ace of clubs</p>
```

This CSS grabs these elements and applies these styles.

```css
// This is the CSS file

.card {
  background-color: pink;
}

.face-up {
  font-size: 20px;
}

.page-link {
  font: 'comic-sans';
}
```

## IDs

An ID used on one and only one element.  Just like each person has their own driver's license or  membership number unique to them, an ID should be unique.  An ID is written as an attribute-value pair inside the opening tag of an element:

```
<p> This is a regular p tag </p>
<p id="unique" > This paragraph is unique in its styling </p>
```

This is how to write an ID in CSS (notice that an ID is denoted with a hash or pound sign (#) before the name of the ID:

```
#unique{
    color: green;
    font-size: 25px;
    }
```

The font size of the paragraph with id "unique" will be 25px and its text will be color green.&#x20;

As stated before, only one ID can be applied to an element, though if you break this rule you won't get any errors, maybe just some unintended behaviours. An element can have both an ID and a class, or multiple classes..

```markup
<p id="player-card-one" class="card face-up">ace of spades</p>
```

This CSS grabs the paragraph with the player-card-one ID above and applies the style rules that create a solid red border that is 3px wide.

```css
#player-card-one {
  border: 3px solid red;
}
```

## Basics Starter Code

Take a look at `index.html` from the basics-starter-code. Read through lines 62 to 74, and notice that some HTML elements have ids associated with them. Lines 81-99 reference some of these HTML elements, and defines the logic that has been associating the Submit button and input/output fields to the main function. We will now take a closer look at the syntax and concepts that make this work.
