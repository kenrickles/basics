# Day 3: If Statements and Boolean Or

For each app, make a copy of the starter code, as per the [setup](https://swe101.rocketacademy.co/4-getting-started-with-code/4-2-our-first-program#setup) with `git clone`. When cloning, specify the target directory for each app as a new folder, following the folder structure in [Pro Tips](../course-logistics/pro-tips.md#organising-folders-for-swe101). This is to avoid Git repos inside Git repos, which can cause problems with Git.

For some apps you may need to google things. Remember that as pairs, you are also googling together. Please switch driver and navigator each app.
