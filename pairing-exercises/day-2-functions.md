# Day 2: Functions

## Data Transformations with Functions

For each app, make a copy of the starter code, as in the [setup](https://swe101.rocketacademy.co/4-getting-started-with-code/4-2-our-first-program#setup) with `git clone`. When cloning, put each app in a separate folder, like the folder structure in [Pro Tips](../course-logistics/pro-tips.md#organising-folders-for-swe101). This is to avoid Git repos inside Git repos, which can cause problems with Git.

For some apps you may need to google things. Remember that as pairs, you are also googling together. Please switch driver and navigator each app.

### Singtel

Create a calculator for the 8GB data plan. The user will enter how many GB they used this month and the app will calculate the per-GB cost.

### Air Conditioner

Your aircon uses 2 KW/h. Electricity is $0.20 a KW/h. The user can enter the number of hours they'll use their aircon for, and the app will tell them the cost. 

### Ice Machine

The ice machine at your hotel can produce 120 pounds of ice a day. An average cube weighs 1.5 grams. The user will enter the number of guests at a hotel event. The app will calculate how long the hotel needs to run the machine for @ 2 drinks per guest, 4 cubes per drink.

### Mortgage

Create a mortgage calculator for a bank. This bank is just starting out so their loan terms are simple and the same for everyone. The amount is always the same: $100,000. The interest is 3% APR. The term is 10 years.  
  
Output several values including:

* How much they will pay in total including the principal.
* How much the user will pay just in interest.
* How much their monthly payment will be.
