### Nested Loops to Simulate Dimensions

If we put a loop inside a loop we can represent 2 dimensions of output. Note we use `<br>` to create new rows. `<br>` is a newline HTML tag that can help us format our output.

```javascript
var main = function (input) {
  var myOutputValue = '';
  // Initialise the outer counter, rowCounter
  var rowCounter = 0;
  while (rowCounter < input) {
    // Inside the outer loop, initialise the inner counter, columnCounter
    var columnCounter = 0;
    // Every time the outer loop runs, the inner loop runs repeatedly until
    // the inner loop condition is met.
    while (columnCounter < input) {
      // Each time the inner loop runs, it adds "x" to output
      myOutputValue = myOutputValue + 'x';
      columnCounter = columnCounter + 1;
    }
    // At the end of each outer loop, add a <br> tag to begin a new row
    myOutputValue = myOutputValue + '<br>';
    rowCounter = rowCounter + 1;
  }
  // After the outer loop has run to completion, return the output compiled
  // by the above loops.
  return myOutputValue;
};
```

## For Loops

Most languages have variations on the while loop above that behave similarly. One common variation is the "for loop". For loops are a more concise syntax for looping over a fixed number of iterations. Whenever we have a fixed number of iterations we should use a for loop if possible. The 2 following examples behave the same, but the for loop syntax is more concise.

### While Loop Syntax

```javascript
// Initialise counter
var counter = 0;
// Declare loop condition
while (counter < 10) {
  console.log('hello');
  // Increment counter
  counter += 1;
}
```

### For Loop Syntax

```javascript
// Initialise counter, declare loop condition, and increment counter in 1 line
for (var counter = 0; counter < 10; counter += 1) {
  console.log('hello');
}
```

The key difference in for loop syntax is that **all loop management code is consolidated in the top parenthesis group**. However, when the code runs, each step actually **happens in the same order as in the while loop example**. These steps are the following.

1. Declare and initialise counter variable
2. Evaluate condition
3. Increment counter

To solidify understanding of loops, we suggest using while loops until you are comfortable with loop mechanics.

{% hint style="info" %}
In other code examples you may see the incrementation step replaced by `counter++`. This adds 1 to `counter`. At RA we prefer ESLint's recommendation of `counter += 1` syntax. See ESLint's reasons against `++` syntax [here](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-plusplus).

### Drawing Intro

Use loops to create an app that draws emojis into the grey box. Begin the app by **forking** this repo: [https://github.com/rocketacademy/basics-drawing](https://github.com/rocketacademy/basics-drawing). See [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-10-keyboard-tips-and-tricks-588e0b72-0fff-6d3f-aeee-6e5116097942) for how to input Emoji on Windows and [here](https://support.apple.com/en-sg/guide/mac-help/mchlp1560/mac) for how to input emoji on Mac.

### Number of Characters

The user will enter a number of characters to display on the screen.

For example, if the user enters 4 they will see this:

### Square

The user will enter the dimensions of a square to display on the screen.

Use a loop within a loop and the `<br>` HTML tag in your output to create the square.

For example, if the user enters 4 they will see this:

![](../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-08-26-at-12.35.12-am.png)

## More Comfortable Exercises

### Triangle

The user will enter the dimensions of a triangle to display on the screen.â€Œ

Use a loop within a loop, a conditional and the `<br>` HTML tag in your output to create the triangle.

For example, if the user enters 4 they will see this:

![](../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-08-26-at-12.37.35-am.png)

### Outline Square

The user will enter the dimensions of a square to display on the screen. The square is outlined by a different character.

For example, if the user enters 4 they will see this:

![](../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-08-26-at-12.54.56-am.png)
