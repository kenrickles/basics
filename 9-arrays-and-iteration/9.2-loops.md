# 9.2: Loops

## Introduction

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/wn3G\_OO32kg" caption="" %}

We've defined an array, added values to it, and inspected those values individually, but haven't yet learned how to systematically manipulate each element in the array, no matter how long the array is. To do this we will learn 1 more control structure: "**loops"**.

In SWE101 we will mostly use loops to iterate over array elements. Loops can also be used without arrays, for example to perform an action until a condition is no longer true, but we will not see this often in SWE101.

A loop defines a code block \(with curly braces\) that runs until the loop condition is no longer met. We'll look at loops in isolation first, then see them in the context of arrays.

## While Loop

While loops are the most fundamental type of loop in programming, and the concept exists in many programming languages. The following is a "while loop" that runs 10 times, i.e. until its condition is no longer met. Notice how we define a counter before the loop, and increment the counter at the end of the loop. The loop finishes when the counter reaches 10.

```javascript
// Initialise a counter to 0.
var counter = 0;
// Set the while loop condition to continue when counter is less than 10.
while (counter < 10) {
  // Log hello with each iteration of the loop.
  console.log('hello');
  // Increment the counter by 1 at the end of each loop iteration.
  counter = counter + 1;
}
```

### While Loop with Input-Based Condition

Let's create a program that outputs values in a loop, where the loop condition depends on user input.

```javascript
var main = function (input) {
  var myOutputValue = '';
  var counter = 0;
  // Continue the loop while counter is less than the input value
  while (counter < input) {
    // Add 1 "yes" to the output for every loop iteration.
    myOutputValue = myOutputValue + 'yes';
    counter = counter + 1;
  }
  return myOutputValue;
};
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note that except for rare exceptions, the incrementation of the counter \(`counter = counter + 1`\) should be the last statement in the loop block. If you find yourself writing any statements below that, it may not be what you intended.
{% endhint %}

### While Loop with Input-Based Condition and Conditionals

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/ozrUPHZWfIw" caption="" %}

Let's create a program that outputs values in a loop, where loop condition depends on user input, with additional conditional statements inside the loop. In the following example, the conditionals inside the loop help the program combine 2 different strings into program output.

```javascript
var main = function (input) {
  var myOutputValue = '';
  var counter = 0;
  // Continue the loop while counter is less than the input value
  while (counter < input) {
    // If counter is less than 5, add "yes" to output
    if (counter < 5) {
      myOutputValue = myOutputValue + 'yes';
    // Otherwise, add "no" to output
    } else {
      myOutputValue = myOutputValue + 'no';
    }
    counter = counter + 1;
  }
  return myOutputValue;
};
```

### Logic Variations

Loops and conditionals alone are powerful tools to create output patterns. One of the main tricks with loops is identifying the pattern we want and working backward to construct the logic within the loop. The following example uses the modulus \(`%`\) operator in a conditional in a loop to alternate strings in output.

```javascript
var counter = 0;
while (counter < input) {
  // If counter is even, add "yes" to output
  // The modulus (%) operator returns the remainder after division
  // If a number divided by 2 equals 0, we consider it even.
  if (counter % 2 == 0) {
    myOutputValue = myOutputValue + 'yes';
  // Otherwise, add "no" to output
  } else {
    myOutputValue = myOutputValue + 'no';
  }
  counter = counter + 1;
}
```

## Loops and Functions

We can combine a loop and a function together, effectively moving a block of code outside the loop definition. \(Obviously you can also do the reverse- put a loop inside a function\).

We can use the `diceRoll` function elsewhere and it also helps to keep our code clean inside the loop block.

```javascript
var diceRoll = function () {
  // produces a decimal between 0 and 6
  var randomDecimal = Math.random() * 6;

  // take off the decimal
  var randomInteger = Math.floor(randomDecimal);

  // it's anumber from 0 - 5 ... add 1
  var diceNumber = randomInteger + 1;

  return diceNumber;
};

var main = function (input) {
  var myOutputValue = '';

  var counter = 0;

  while (counter < input) {
    // roll the dice inside the loop
    var roll = diceRoll();
    myOutputValue = myOutputValue + ' ' + roll + ' ';

    counter = counter + 1;
  }

  return myOutputValue;
};
```

## Loops and Loops - Outputting Program with Dimensions

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/wxUafGMsOw4" caption="" %}

Let's create a program that outputs things in a loop based on some input. If we put another loop inside the loop we can represent other _lines_ of output.

Note we are using `<br>` to create a new line.

```javascript
var main = function (input) {
  var myOutputValue = '';

  var lineCounter = 0;

  while (lineCounter < input) {
    var columnCounter = 0;

    while (columnCounter < input) {
      myOutputValue = myOutputValue + 'x';

      columnCounter = columnCounter + 1;
    }

    // start a new line
    myOutputValue = myOutputValue + '<br>';

    lineCounter = lineCounter + 1;
  }

  return myOutputValue;
};
```

## For Loops

Most languages have variations on the syntax above that behave similarly. One variation we will encounter relatively frequently is the "for loop" syntax. For loops loop over a fixed number of iterations, and are a more concise syntax for doing so. Whenever we have a fixed number of iterations we should use a for loop if possible. The 2 following examples behave the same, but the for loop syntax is more concise.

#### While Loop Syntax

```javascript
var counter = 0;
while (counter < 10) {
  console.log('hello');
  counter += 1;
}
```

#### For Loop Syntax

```javascript
for (var counter = 0; counter < 10; counter += 1) {
  console.log('hello');
}
```

You may also see the incrementation step replaced by: `counter++`. This adds 1 to `counter`. At RA we prefer ESLint's recommendation of `counter += 1` syntax. See ESLint's reasons against `++` syntax [here](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-plusplus).

The key difference in for loop syntax is that **all loop management code is consolidated in the top parenthesis group**. However, when the code runs, each step actually **happens in the same order as in the while loop example**. These steps are the following.

1. Declare and initialise counter variable
2. Evaluate condition
3. Increment counter

We suggest sticking with while loops until you are comfortable with the mechanics of the loop syntax.
