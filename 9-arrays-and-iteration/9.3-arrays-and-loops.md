# 9.3: Arrays and Loops

{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMsjCb19\_9s" %}



We want our programs to be able to deal with a set of data, `guesses` or some other value, which, at any given point of the program, could have a different number of items inside.

We can use loops to visit each item in the array and run some code for that item.

The trick is that we can make an equivalence between the `counter` we had in the loop and the `index` we had for the array, by using the `length` of the array.

This is a value given to us for any array:

```javascript
var letters = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
```

```javascript
letters.length
```

We use `length` to know how many times to run the loop.

We use `counter` to access the location of each item in the array.

```javascript
var index = 0;
var letters = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
var letterLength = letters.length;

while (index < letterLength) {
  var currentLoopLetter = letters[index];

  console.log(currentLoopLetter);

  index = index + 1;
}
```

Let's make a simple program that demonstrates the use of loops and arrays.

Our app is an address book that keeps names and doesn't add a new one if it's already in the book.

```javascript
var names = [];

var main = function (input) {
  // look at all the names and make sure it's not in there yet
  var found = false;
  var index = 0;
  while (index < names.length) {
    var currentName = names[index];

    if (currentName == input) {
      found = true;
    }

    index = index + 1;
  }

  // we didn't find the name, put it in
  if (found == false) {
    names.push(input);
  }

  var myOutputValue = 'All your names: ' + names;

  return myOutputValue;
};
```
