# 9.3: Loops with Arrays

## Introduction

Often we want to perform actions on all elements of arrays of arbitrary length. We can use loops to run code on each array element sequentially.

The trick to using loops with arrays that we can make an equivalence between the `counter` we had in the loop and the `index` we had for the array, by using the `length` of the array.

This is a value given to us for any array:

```javascript
var letters = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
```

```javascript
letters.length;
```

We use `length` to know how many times to run the loop.

We use `counter` to access the location of each item in the array.

```javascript
var index = 0;
var letters = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
var letterLength = letters.length;

while (index < letterLength) {
  var currentLoopLetter = letters[index];

  console.log(currentLoopLetter);

  index = index + 1;
}
```

Let's make a simple program that demonstrates the use of loops and arrays.

Our app is an address book that keeps names and doesn't add a new one if it's already in the book.

```javascript
var names = [];

var main = function (input) {
  // look at all the names and make sure it's not in there yet
  var found = false;
  var index = 0;
  while (index < names.length) {
    var currentName = names[index];

    if (currentName == input) {
      found = true;
    }

    index = index + 1;
  }

  // we didn't find the name, put it in
  if (found == false) {
    names.push(input);
  }

  var myOutputValue = 'All your names: ' + names;

  return myOutputValue;
};
```
