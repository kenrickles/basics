# 9.2: Loops

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/wn3G\_OO32kg" %}

We've defined an array and looked inside of it and added values, but we don't yet have anything that can deal with the entire array. Or specifically that can deal with **each** item in the array, when the array is an arbitrary length.

For that we are going to add the last control structure we'll use, **loops**.

In the context of games we'll see a few uses of loops that don't have to do with arrays, but from the point of view of software that manipulates input data, the concept of the loop is very much tied to the concept of the array.

A loop defines a **block** of code \(with curly braces\) that will run a set number of times.

A loop relies on a **condition** to tell it to keep running or not.

We'll look at loops in isolation first, then we'll see that they match up perfectly with how an array works.

## while

This is a loop that runs 10 times.

```javascript
var counter = 0;

while (counter < 10) {
  console.log('hello');

  counter = counter + 1;
}
```

### outputting program

Let's create a program that outputs things in a loop based on some input.

```javascript
var main = function (input) {
  var myOutputValue = '';

  var counter = 0;

  while (counter < input) {
    myOutputValue = myOutputValue + 'yes';

    counter = counter + 1;
  }

  return myOutputValue;
};
```

### outputting program with logic

Let's create a program that outputs things in a loop based on some input. If we put a conditional inside the loop we can have it output two types of things.

```javascript
var main = function (input) {
  var myOutputValue = '';

  var counter = 0;

  while (counter < input) {
    if( counter < 5 ){
      myOutputValue = myOutputValue + 'yes';
    }else{
      myOutputValue = myOutputValue + 'no';
    }
    counter = counter + 1;
  }

  return myOutputValue;
};
```

### outputting program with dimensions

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/wxUafGMsOw4" %}

Let's create a program that outputs things in a loop based on some input. If we put another loop inside the loop we can represent other _lines_ of output.

Note we are using `<br>` to create a new line.

```javascript
var main = function (input) {
  var myOutputValue = '';

  var lineCounter = 0;

  while (lineCounter < input) {
    var columnCounter = 0;
  
    while (columnCounter < input) {
      myOutputValue = myOutputValue + 'x';

      columnCounter = columnCounter + 1;
    }

    // start a new line
    myOutputValue = myOutputValue + '<br>';
  
    lineCounter = lineCounter + 1;
  }

  return myOutputValue;
};
```

**1\) Implement the above code.**

**2\) Drawing**

Use loops to create an app that draws emojis into the grey box.

Begin the app by **forking** this repo: [https://github.com/rocketacademy/swe101-drawing](https://github.com/rocketacademy/swe101-drawing)

## Number of Characters

The user will enter a number of characters to display on the screen.

For example, if the user enters 4 they will see this:

![](../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-08-26-at-12.35.32-am.png)

## Square

The user will enter the dimensions of a square to display on the screen.

Use a loop within a loop and the `<br>` tag in your output to create the square.

For example, if the user enters 4 they will see this:

![](../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-08-26-at-12.35.12-am.png)

## More Comfortable

### 

##  Triangle

The user will enter the dimensions of a triangle to display on the screen.â€Œ

Use a loop within a loop, a conditional and the `<br>` tag in your output to create the triangle.

For example, if the user enters 4 they will see this:

![](../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-08-26-at-12.37.35-am.png)

### 

### Outline Square

The user will enter the dimensions of a square to display on the screen. The square is outlined by a different character.

For example, if the user enters 4 they will see this:
