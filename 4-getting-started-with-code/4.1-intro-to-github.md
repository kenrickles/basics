# 4.1: Intro to GitHub

GitHub is the web application that hosts our git repositories in the cloud.

## History

Git was originally invented to coordinate the development of the Linux operating system across many geographically scattered developers. Each git repo is capable of recording a set of commits on a user's computer and to coordinate that history of changes with others. Because the work was open-source git allows for anyone to hold a copy of the code and for anyone to have any set of history they like.

## GitHub

Github is a centralized set of repositories developers use to hold the "master" copy of their code.

## Clone

We'll use a git command to download a copy of the code. We won't be concerned yet with reconciling any changes happening locally with what's on GitHub.

```text
git clone <repo url> folder-name
```
