GitHub is a web application that hosts Git repositories on the internet. It is a centralised set of repositories developers use to hold "official" copies of their code.

### Why Use GitHub?

In Basics we'll be using GitHub as a place to download starter code, and, when we cover [7.1](../7-github/7.1-github-fork-and-pull-request.md) \(GitHub Fork and Pull Request\) we'll use it to submit projects and store our code and code versions online.

Don't worry for now if the structure of local and remote repositories seems confusing, we'll be covering these topics again more in-depth in [7.1](../7-github/7.1-github-fork-and-pull-request.md) and [7.2](../7-github/7.2-github-repo-browsing.md).

## Git Clone

We'll use a Git command to download or "clone" a copy of Coding Basics starter code. `<REPO_DOWNLOAD_URL>` is the download URL of our repo, obtained by clicking the Download Code button on the repo's [GitHub page](https://github.com/rocketacademy/basics-starter-code). `<LOCAL_REPO_FOLDER_NAME>` is the name of the folder that is created \(containing the contents of the repo\) when we run the Git command. In Coding Basics, we will typically use the current exercise name as the local repo folder name.

**Command Template**

```text
git clone <REPO_DOWNLOAD_URL> <LOCAL_REPO_FOLDER_NAME>
```

**Sample Command**

```text
git clone https://github.com/rocketacademy/basics-starter-code.git basics-starter-code-test
```

GitHub enables us to coordinate differences between local and "official" versions of the code, but we won't concern ourselves with that just yet.

## Exercises

Follow along with the video to create a copy of the Coding Basics starter code repo. You'll find the repo download URL at the repo [GitHub page](https://github.com/rocketacademy/basics-starter-code).
