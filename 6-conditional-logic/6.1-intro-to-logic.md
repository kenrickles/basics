# 6.1: Intro to Logic

## Introduction

So far our apps have always performed the same calculation, no matter the input. The next level of complexity is to create programs that perform different logic depending on the input.

## If Statement

An "**if statement**" is a control-flow "**code block**" that runs if a condition is `true`. A code block is a section of code surrounded by curly braces. We'll talk more about what `true` means more specifically later.

### Simple Conditional Example: Secret Phrase

Let's write a program that changes the output value of `"hello world"` if we type in a particular phrase.

```javascript
var main = function (input) {
  var myOutputValue = 'hello world';

  if (input == 'palatable papaya') {
    myOutputValue = 'you wrote the secret phrase!';
  }

  return myOutputValue;
};
```

Our if statement is on line 4. The conditional inside it tests if `input` is equal to `'palatable papaya'`, our secret phrase. If `input` is equal to `'palatable papaya'`, the code runs between the curly braces on lines 4 and 6, i.e. the "if block". If `input` is not equal to our phrase, the if block does not run.

Code blocks may or may not run depending on "[**control flow**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow)", i.e. the logic of our app. The 1st way we learned to use code blocks was with functions. If statements are a 2nd way. We'll learn a 3rd code block syntax later in [9.2: Loops](../9-arrays-and-iteration/9.2-loops.md).

Try inputting secret and non-secret phrases into the program. Enter the secret phrase and click the button to see the different output. Enter anything else and click the button to see the default output.

### Equality

We're using the "[**comparison operator**](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/fwd-js-comparison-logical#:~:text=Comparison%20operators%20%E2%80%94%20operators%20that%20compare,%3C%3D%20%2C%20%3D%3D%3D%20%2C%20and%20!%3D%3D&text=Logical%20operators%20%E2%80%94%20operators%20that%20combine,%26%26%20%2C%20%7C%7C%20%2C%20and%20!%20.)" `==` to test if `input` is equal to `'palatable papaya'`.

## Comments

Now that things are getting more complicated, we might want to leave notes to ourselves and others that say what our code does.

Comments let you write things in the code file that are just notes.

```javascript
// this won't actually run
```

## Dice game

Let's build a game of dice program. We will begin with very simple rules to this game: guess the number we will roll.

### Randomness / Dice

Let's build the random number generation before we talk about the dice game logic.

JavaScript language can produce random numbers using a build-in set of functions called `Math` \(case-sensitive\).

```javascript
var myRandomValue = Math.random();
```

Calling `Math.random()` returns a random decimal number value between 0 and 1, inclusive of 0 and exclusive of 1. However we have a dice game, so we have to do some math on this number to get what we want.

We'll be using another math functionality: `Math.floor()`. We will use the code referred to on this [page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random).

With `Math.random()` and `Math.floor()`, we can make a function that produces any random integer from 0 to a provided `max` number:

```javascript
var getRandomInteger = function (max) {
  // produce a decimal from 0 through max + 1, exclusive of max + 1.
  var randomDecimal = Math.random() * (max + 1);

  // take off the decimal
  // this will be a number from 0 through max, inclusive of max.
  var resultInteger = Math.floor(randomDecimal);

  return resultInteger;
};
```

But what we are creating is a dice rolling game, so we can just make a `diceRoll` function that produces a random integer from 1 to 6:

```javascript
var diceRoll = function () {
  // produces a decimal from 0 *up to* 6 (but not including 6).
  var randomDecimal = Math.random() * 6;

  // take off the decimal
  // this will be a number from 0 to 5.
  var randomInteger = Math.floor(randomDecimal);

  // Add 1 to get valid dice numbers of 1 through 6.
  var diceNumber = randomInteger + 1;

  return diceNumber;
};
```

### Game: Dice Roll Guess

Let's implement the logical rules to our game.

If the dice roll the same number as the user entered, they win.

```javascript
var main = function (input) {
  var randomDiceNumber = diceRoll();

  var myOutputValue = 'you lose';

  if (randomDiceNumber == input) {
    myOutputValue = 'you win';
  }

  return myOutputValue;
};
```

## Exercises

For each app, clone a new copy of the [starter code](https://github.com/rocketacademy/swe101-starter-code) using Git.

### **Follow Along**

Duplicate and run the code above.

### **Multiples App**

The user wins the game if the dice roll is 2x the guess. For example, guess of 1 and roll of 2, guess of 2 and roll of 4, etc. To win for a 6-sided dice, the user should only guess numbers between 1-3, but the game does not restrict what they can guess.
