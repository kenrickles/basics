# 6.3: Boolean And, Not

## Introduction

In [6.2: Pseudo-Code, Boolean Or](6.2-pseudo-code-boolean-or.md) we learned how to pseudo-code and use logical OR operators. In this module we will learn about the following.

1. Code control: how to control program inputs to quickly verify program logic.
2. Boolean values: what are boolean values and how are they stored in JavaScript?
3. Boolean AND operator
4. Boolean NOT operator
5. Conditional debugging: how to efficiently debug conditional logic.

## Code Control

We've written pseudo-code, we've written JavaScript, we've controlled and tested our logic, yet our code could still have errors. Let's analyse common conditional errors and learn strategies to diagnose them.

### Consider Common Conditional Errors

#### Boolean Expression Not Evaluating to True

When we use `&&` , both boolean statements must be true for the combined statement to be true. If we only need 1 of the boolean statements to be true, use `||` instead.

#### Boolean Expression has Syntax Error

Did we unintentionally use the assignment operator `=` instead of the comparison operator `==`?

#### Incorrect Logic in Boolean Statement

Are the parentheses in our boolean statement arranged such that the boolean logic matches what we wish to accomplish?

### Deconstruct and Verify Each Condition

If the above common conditional errors are insufficient to debug our problem, we can use a more fine-grained debugging strategy. By now, many of our conditionals comprise multiple boolean statements connected by logical operators such as `||`, `&&`, and `!`. If the program behaviour is incorrect, we can methodically deconstruct our conditionals to verify each component.

For a given conditional like the following, we can console log each component of the conditional. We can then inspect each variable and boolean expression value. Note the helpfulness of labelling each console log for output clarity. Try not to introduce bugs while debugging by mislabeling console logs.

#### Sample Conditional

```javascript
if (
  randomDiceNumber == input ||
  randomDiceNumber + 1 == input ||
  randomDiceNumber - 1 == input
) {
  myOutputValue = 'you win';
}
```

#### Sample Debugging Code

```javascript
console.log('random dice number:');
console.log(randomDiceNumber);
console.log('input');
console.log(input);
console.log('random dice equals input:');
console.log(randomDiceNumber == input);
console.log('random dice plus 1 equals input:');
console.log(randomDiceNumber + 1 == input);
console.log('random dice minus 1 equals input:');
console.log(randomDiceNumber - 1 == input);
```

## Exercises

For each app, clone a new copy of the [starter code](https://github.com/rocketacademy/basics-starter-code) using Git.

### Follow Along

Duplicate and run the dice game versions above.

### New Winning Conditions

Create new versions of our dice game for each of the following winning conditions.

1. User wins if guess is within 1 for any of 2 dice.
2. User wins if guess is within 1 for all 2 dice.
3. User wins if guess is within 1 but the user does not roll snake eyes.
4. User wins if guess is within 1 or if the user rolls snake eyes.
