# Operations

Coding means writing instructions for the computer to execute.

We will begin with the most basic kinds of instructions the computer can execute, which is an operation between 2 data values.

**Instructions:**

Open a new tab in the chrome browser. \(file menu -&gt; new tab _or_ `cmd + t`\)

Open the developer tools. \(view -&gt; developer -&gt; javascript console _or_ `cmd + option + i` _or_ right click anywhere in the chrome window and choose `insepct`\)

Make sure you've selected the javascript console tab in the dev tools.

### Math Operations

The javascript language is capable of calculating math operations.

Type these one at a time into the console and hit enter:

```javascript
2 + 2
```

```javascript
4 * 2
```

```javascript
4 / 2
```

```javascript
4 - 2
```

### Data

Our programs will soon have the ability to process data.

First we need to talk about what data is inside a javascript program and how it's represented.
