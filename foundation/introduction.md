# Introduction

## What is a program?

For the purposes of this course we will constrain our definition of what coding / programming means and what a program is used for.

We'll define a program as: **instructions to the computer to process an input and give an output**.

## What is coding?

Coding is distinct from the _program_ that a coder produces.

The process of coding includes:

* translate a set of real-world data into a set of abstractions
* representation and abstraction of data inside the computer
* what operations the computer must make on that data
* what output is given and the representation of that output
