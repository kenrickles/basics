Bank roll or score is an application of the global "counter" variable to our dice game. In the following example, we increment `bankRoll` every time the player correctly guesses the dice roll.

```javascript
var bankRoll = 10;

var main = function (input) {
  var randomDiceNumber = rollDice();

  var myOutputValue = 'you lose. current bank roll: ' + bankRoll;

  if (randomDiceNumber == input) {
    bankRoll = bankRoll + 1;

    myOutputValue = 'you win. current bank roll: ' + bankRoll;
  }

  return myOutputValue;
};
```

## Exercises \(Base\)

### Follow Along

Follow along with the videos and duplicate the code.

### **App Setup**

For the following exercises, start with the [Coding Basics Starter Code repo](https://github.com/rocketacademy/basics-starter-code) and replace the code in `script.js` with the following dice game code.

```javascript
var rollDice = function () {
  // produces a decimal between 0 and 6
  var randomDecimal = Math.random() * 6;

  // take off the decimal
  var randomInteger = Math.floor(randomDecimal);

  // it's anumber from 0 - 5 ... add 1
  var diceNumber = randomInteger + 1;

  return diceNumber;
};

var main = function (input) {
  var randomDiceNumber = rollDice();

  var myOutputValue = 'you lose';

  if (randomDiceNumber == input) {
    myOutputValue = 'you win';
  }

  return myOutputValue;
};
```

### **Last Roll**

Create a version of the dice game that tells the user what their previous dice roll was.

#### Sample Output

```text
Your last roll was 4. You just rolled a 3. You guessed 3. You win!
```

### **Win / Loss**

As the user continues to play the game, tell them what their current win / loss percentage is.

#### Sample Output

```text
You win 23.5% of the time. You just rolled a 4. You guessed 3. You lose!
```

## Exercises \(More Comfortable\)

### **Most Rolled**

Keep track of the number that's rolled the most times.

#### Sample Output

```text
You just rolled a 4. 2 is the number you roll the most. You guessed 3. You lose!
```

### **Guessing**

If the player guess is off-by-1 they win 1 point. If the player guess is exact they win 2 points.

### **Advanced Guessing**

The player guess can be off by up to 4. If the player guess is off-by-4 they win 1 point. Off-by-3, 2 points, off-by-2, 3 points, off-by-1, 4 points, exact, 5 points.
