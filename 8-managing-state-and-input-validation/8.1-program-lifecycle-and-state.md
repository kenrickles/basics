# 8.1: Program Lifecycle and State

## Introduction

{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxxwcMJN8ec" caption="" %}

Our programs have so far only handled ephemeral data that exists only while `main` or the relevant parent function is running. Now we will start to handle data that persists _across_ runs of the `main` function, and functions in our app in general.

## Global Variables

We will use our dice game to demonstrate the value of data persistence. In a dice game, we may want to keep track of the "bank roll" or score for the duration of our game. We need a syntax to store a value \(bank roll in this case\) that we read and update when `main` runs and is also available the _next time_ `main` runs.

The syntax we will use is called "**global variables**". Global variables in SWE101 will persist from when the program loads in the browser to when we close the tab or reload the page. Try running the following code line by line in Chrome DevTools. The variable `number` persists across our commands, but when we refresh the page, `number` is no longer available. Similarly, our global variable data will persist across function calls, but not across browser sessions.

```javascript
var number = 5;
number = number * 2;
number;
```

### Main Function Scope

As a recap of "local variables", recall the `main` function we've been using so far. In this function, `myOutputValue` only exists during the execution of `main`, corresponding to 1 Submit-button click.

```javascript
var main = function (input) {
  var myOutputValue = convertKmToMiles(input);
  return myOutputValue;
};
```

If we try to inspect the value of `myOutputValue` in the console after clicking Submit, `myOutputValue` doesn't exist.

```javascript
myOutputValue;
```

This behaviour is common to all variables declared inside a function. They are available for the life of that function, then they disappear.

### Global State

```javascript
var papayaCount = 0;

var main = function (input) {
  var myOutputValue = 'You have ' + papayaCount + ' papayas';
  return myOutputValue;
};
```

## Dice Guessing

Let's add guessing on the dice roll.

```javascript
var bankRoll = 10;

var main = function (input) {
  var randomDiceNumber = rollDice();

  var myOutputValue = 'you lose. current bank roll: ' + bankRoll;

  if (randomDiceNumber == input) {
    bankRoll = bankRoll + 1;

    myOutputValue = 'you win. current bank roll: ' + bankRoll;
  }

  return myOutputValue;
};
```

## Exercises \(Base\)

### Follow Along

Follow along with the video and duplicate the code.

### **App Setup**

Put this basic dice game into the starter code:

```javascript
var rollDice = function () {
  // produces a decimal between 0 and 6
  var randomDecimal = Math.random() * 6;

  // take off the decimal
  var randomInteger = Math.floor(randomDecimal);

  // it's anumber from 0 - 5 ... add 1
  var diceNumber = randomInteger + 1;

  return diceNumber;
};

var main = function (input) {
  var randomDiceNumber = rollDice();

  var myOutputValue = 'you lose';

  if (randomDiceNumber == input) {
    myOutputValue = 'you win';
  }

  return myOutputValue;
};
```

### **Last Roll**

Create a version of the dice game that tells the user what their previous dice roll was.

#### Example

```text
Your last roll was 4. You just rolled a 3. You guessed 3. You win!
```

### **Win / Loss**

As the user continues to play the game, tell them what their current win / loss percentage is.

#### Example

```text
You win 23.5% of the time. You just rolled a 4. You guessed 3. You lose!
```

## Exercises \(More Comfortable\)

### **Most Rolled**

Keep track of the number that's rolled the most times.

Example:

```text
You just rolled a 4. 2 is the number you roll the most. You guessed 3. You lose!
```

### **Guessing**

If the user guess is off by 1 they win 1. If it's exact they win 2.

### **Advanced Guessing**

The user can be off up to 4. They win 1 if they are off by 4 and win 4 if they guess exactly.
