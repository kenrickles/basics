# Course Overview

## Welcome to Coding Basics! 

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/7Bx4LTD9guo" %}

[Coding Basics](https://rocketacademy.co/courses/basics) is Rocket Academy \(RA\)'s beginner course for software programming, also known as coding. It is the first course in RA's software engineering curriculum, teaching basic coding syntax and concepts through building simple programs. Students interested to pursue a career in coding can join RA's bootcamp course [Coding Bootcamp](https://rocketacademy.co/courses/bootcamp) after Basics to build more complex software systems and get a job as a software engineer.

## Coding Bootcamp Acceptance Criteria

For students that wish to join RA's Coding Bootcamp, at the end of Coding Basics, RA will evaluate whether each student qualifies to join Bootcamp. To qualify for Bootcamp, students must complete all projects and demonstrate the following qualities up to RA's standards. Instructors will provide code reviews for each project, and students are expected to implement feedback in subsequent projects.

1. Proficiency with technical syntax \(variables, functions, conditionals, loops, data structures\) and tools \(VSCode, Git, GitHub, Chrome DevTools\)
2. Computational thinking to translate application requirements to code
   1. Decomposition: Each function performs 1 conceptual operation
   2. Data Representation: Use relevant data structure for each problem
   3. Abstraction: Re-use helper functions with varying parameter values when possible
   4. Algorithms: Construct stepwise logic to accomplish tasks
3. Code quality \(naming, code comments\)
