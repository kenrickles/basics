# Course Overview

## Welcome to Coding Basics!

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/7Bx4LTD9guo" caption="" %}

[Coding Basics](https://rocketacademy.co/courses/basics) is Rocket Academy \(RA\)'s beginner course for software programming, also known as coding. It is the first course in RA's software engineering curriculum, teaching basic coding syntax and concepts through building simple programs. Students interested in pursuing a career in software engineering can join RA's bootcamp course, [Coding Bootcamp](https://rocketacademy.co/courses/bootcamp), after Basics to build more complex software systems and obtain employment in the industry.

## Coding Bootcamp Acceptance Criteria

RA will assess students who wish to join Coding Bootcamp at the end of Coding Basics to determine if they meet RA's standards. Acceptance into Coding Bootcamp is based on the following criteria.

* Proficiency with technical syntax \(variables, functions, conditionals, loops, data structures\) and tools \(VSCode, Git, GitHub, Chrome DevTools\)
* Code quality \(naming, code comments\)
* Computational thinking, i.e., ability to translate application requirements to code

  1. Decomposition: Each function performs 1 conceptual operation
  2. Data Representation: Use of relevant data structures for each problem
  3. Abstraction: Re-use helper functions with varying parameter values when possible
  4. Algorithms: Construct stepwise logic to accomplish tasks

Students are also expected to have completed ALL projects in Basics.  The instructors will provide code reviews after every project and students are also expected to implement feedback given by them in subsequent projects.
