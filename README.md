# Overview

## Welcome to SWE101! 

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/7Bx4LTD9guo" %}

[SWE101: Intro to Coding](https://rocketacademy.co/swe101) is Rocket Academy \(RA\)'s beginner course for software programming, also known as coding. It is the first course in RA's software engineering curriculum, teaching basic coding syntax and concepts through building simple programs. Students interested to pursue a career in coding can join RA's bootcamp course [SWE1: Software Engineering Foundations](https://rocketacademy.co/swe1) after SWE101 to build more complex software systems and get a job as a software engineer.

## Key Takeaways from SWE101

1. Computational thinking skills to translate application requirements to code, using coding concepts such as functions, conditionals, loops, and data structures to build applications
2. An understanding of what distinguishes "good" code from "not-so-good" code, with regard to naming, commenting, and decomposition
3. Proficiency in professional developer tools such as the [VSCode code editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Git version control system](https://git-scm.com/), [GitHub code hosting platform](https://github.com/), and [Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools).
