# ðŸš€ Welcome to SWE101!

## Introduction

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/7Bx4LTD9guo" %}

SWE101 is Rocket Academy \(RA\)'s foundational course in software programming, also known as coding. This is the first course in RA's software engineering curriculum because one must learn basic coding concepts and syntax before starting to engineer larger software systems.

In this course you will learn what code is and build some simple programs. Though the course is short, we hope to enable your further learnings about \*any\* computer system in the future.

Key Takeaways:

1. Computational Thinking - how to model the behaviour of a computer
2. Technical knowledge about how to use coding concepts such as functions, conditionals, loops, and data structures to build applications
3. An understanding of what distinguishes "good" code from "not-so-good" code, with regard to naming, commenting, and decomposition
4. Proficiency in professional developer tools such as the VSCode code editor, Git version control system, and GitHub code hosting platform.
