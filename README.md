# Overview

## Welcome to SWE101! 

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/7Bx4LTD9guo" %}

[SWE101: Intro to Coding](https://rocketacademy.co/swe101) is Rocket Academy \(RA\)'s beginner course for software programming, also known as coding. It is the first course in RA's software engineering curriculum, teaching basic coding syntax and concepts through building simple programs. Students interested to pursue a career in coding can join RA's bootcamp course [SWE1: Software Engineering Foundations](https://rocketacademy.co/swe1) after SWE101 to build more complex software systems and get a job as a software engineer.

## Criteria to Join SWE1 Bootcamp

Students that perform well during SWE101 will qualify to join RA's coding bootcamp SWE1. The following are key takeaways from SWE101 and how RA evaluates students for SWE1.

1. Proficiency with technical syntax \(variables, functions, conditionals, loops, data structures\) and tools \(VSCode, Git, GitHub, Chrome DevTools\)
2. Computational thinking to translate application requirements to code
   1. Decomposition: Each function performs 1 conceptual operation
   2. Data Representation: Use relevant data structure for each problem
   3. Abstraction: Re-use helper functions with varying parameter values when possible
   4. Algorithms: Construct stepwise logic to accomplish tasks
3. Code quality \(naming, code comments\)
