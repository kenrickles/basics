# 1.1: What is Coding?

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/8xy4TP3quSo" caption="" %}

Coding is the act of writing computer code to form a computer program.

The process of coding includes:

1. translating a set of input data into a set of abstractions inside a computer
2. defining what operations the computer performs on that data
3. determining what output the computer gives and the representation of that output

At their core, all programs, small and large, boil down to this: **instructions to a computer to process an input and give an output**.

#### How many pieces of software can you think of that you use on a daily basis that you don't access through a personal digital device? \(Phone, tablet, laptop, etc.\)

#### How do you give input to this software, how does it give you output

#### Examples: An ATM, your rice cooker, an escalator you take every day
