# 1.2: Web Browsers

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/K7zGrnQ2XOk" caption="" %}

## Why Browsers

Web browsers are tools to view web pages and not necessary for writing and executing code. In SWE101 we will use browsers as a learning tool to visualise inputs and outputs of our code through a web page.

## History

The World Wide Web and web browsers were born in 1990 when Tim Berners-Lee invented a way to view HTML documents through the Internet.

## HTML

The fundamental thing a browser did in 1990 was download and view HTML web site pages.

This is still core to the functionality of how a browser works, so we are going to start there.

## Run starter code in your browser

When you click on [this link](https://github.com/rocketacademy/swe101-starter-code/archive/master.zip) it will download a compressed ZIP file.

If you haven't already, create a `swe101` folder in a local folder, e.g. `Documents`.

Move the downloaded `.zip` file to the `swe101` folder.

Unzip / decompress the file - it should create a new `swe101-starter-code` folder. The starter code files are in this folder.

Open the `index.html` file in Chrome. Double click it if Chrome is your default browser. Or, you can right click to open in Chrome.

### Change text on the page

Change line `41` to something else. Make sure to save the file before you refresh.

Change the text of the button on line `45`.
