# Day 1 - git & starter code

### Git Practice

If you need to, refer to the [git cheatsheet.](../../2-organising-and-managing-code-files/2-2-git.md#cheat-sheet)

#### Create a Haiku

Follow the instructions in the order they appear. 

Create some poetry and save and edit them using the command line and Git.

Open the command line and create a folder for your poetry.

Inside the folder, create a text file in the command line and open it in VSCode.

Write a haiku about trees and save the file. \(A haiku is a Japanese poem that follows the convention of 5 syllables 7 syllable 5 syllable\).

Create a git repo in the folder and add and commit the poetry file.

Edit your poem to reference leaves. Make a commit for your changes.

Add a second poem about winter in another file. Commit this file to the repo.

Title your poem about trees. Add the title to the text in the file, and change the filename to reflect the title. Commit these changes.

Delete your poem about winter from the repo. \(Delete the file and commit the changes\).

### Apps

For each app, make a copy of the starter code, as in the [setup](https://swe101.rocketacademy.co/4-getting-started-with-code/4-2-our-first-program#setup) with `git clone.`

For some apps you made need to Google things. Remember that as pairs, you are also googling together.

**Minutes in a week**

The user will enter a number of weeks. Output the number of minutes in those weeks in the grey box.

Format the output nicely. Like: `In 3 weeks there are 4320 minutes! Wow!`

**Temperatures 1**

The user enters a temperature in Fahrenheit. Output the conversion to kelvin in the grey box. Format the output nicely.

**Temperatures 2**

The user enters a temperature in Celsius. Output the conversion to kelvin and Fahrenheit in the grey box. Format the output nicely.

**Buffet**

There's all you can eat ice cream at the buffet. The buffet receives the ice cream in 400ml containers.

To try to save money the buffet has restricted you to putting your ice cream in a tiny 70ml cup.

The user will enter a number of trips to the ice cream station and the app will calculate how many containers of ice cream you would consume. \(Giving this number of containers in decimal is ok\).

**LPK**

A new Ferrari consumes 9km/liter. Petrol costs $2.20 a liter. The user will enter a trip length in kilometers and the app will give a cost estimate.

**Sonnets**

The user will enter their Words Per Minute typing speed. The app will calculate how long it will take them to type all of Shakespeare's sonnets.
