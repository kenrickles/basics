# Course Methodology ‚úçüèΩ

## Class Organisation

Each cohort will be split into sections of no more than 10 students. Each section will be led by a section leader from RA, who will be the primary point of contact for that section during SWE101. Sections are assigned randomly and fixed for the duration of the course. Students will meet with their respective sections for classes to maximise interaction and learning. Students will be able to interact with students from other sections via Slack.

## Class Schedule

SWE101 applies a flipped classroom model that consists of 2 components: self-learning and live classes.

### Self-Learning

The goal of self-learning is for students to learn concepts before class, such that class time can be spent interacting with peers to solidify one's understanding of the concepts.

**Self-learning is mandatory**, and will consist of videos and exercises due before each class.

### **Live Classes**

The goal of live classes is for students to solidify understanding of concepts through explaining concepts with peers and working through exercises in pairs based on those concepts.

**Live classes are mandatory** and will be held from 1-3pm on Saturdays, 7-9pm on Tuesdays, and 7-9pm on Thursdays over Zoom. There will be 13 classes total. Each section will have their own Zoom room to meet for live classes.

Live classes will generally follow this outline:

1. 15 minutes for students to explain and review concepts with the section
2. 60 minutes of pair programming on new exercises with a designated peer
3. 15 minutes for students to summarise and conclude with the section
4. 30 minutes of office hours where section leaders will be available to answer questions

## Pair Programming

Pair programming is a common software engineering activity that involves 2 engineers working on the same computer, on the same problem together. Typically, 1 engineer acts as the "driver", controlling the keyboard and writing the code. The other engineer acts as the "navigator", helping to guide the overall strategy and look up documentation \(on a separate computer\).

Pair programming is commonly used for the following purposes:

1. To share knowledge across teams or between juniors and seniors, where the navigator is typically more knowledgeable about that part of the system than the driver.
2. To ensure an important piece of software gets done correctly. Sometimes, for difficult software engineering problems with large future repercussions, it is more worth it to spend 2 engineers' time to get it right, than to spend 1 engineer's time and risk getting it wrong.

During SWE101, we will use pair programming to solidify our understanding of concepts by coding and explaining in front of each other. The majority of class time will be spent pair programming with designated pairings that will rotate each class.
