## Window Snapping

On both Windows and MacOS, there are features to automatically snap windows to standard places on your screen. This is especially helpful when, say, you are coding, and you want to view your code on one side and documentation on another. Without window snapping we need to manually drag our windows and resize them. With window snapping, we can get our windows in the right size and place with a single swipe or keyboard shortcut.

### Windows

Window snapping is built-in to windows, and you can take advantage of it with instructions [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/help/4027324/windows-10-snap-your-windows).

### Mac

Window snapping is not built-in to MacOS, and we will need to download an external program to snap windows. We recommend any of the following. 

1. [Magnet](https://magnet.crowdcafe.com/) \(S$5\) is an actively maintained window snapping app on the Mac App Store.
2. [Spectacle](https://www.spectacleapp.com/) \(free\) is similar to Magnet, but is no longer actively maintained, which means that it may stop working when Apple makes changes to MacOS.

## Using VSCode Effectively

### Opening Folders in VSCode

When working with code, it's often necessary to jump between different files in the same repository, or even across repositories. Instead of using File &gt; Open to open a specific _file_ each time, we can save time by opening the _folder_ that contains all the files we may want to access. We can do this on Windows by going to File &gt; Open Folder, or on Mac with File &gt; Open, and selecting the relevant folder. This will open the folder and its file structure in the VSCode sidebar, allowing us to quickly jump between files in that folder without having to File &gt; Open every time.

### Editing Variables in Multiple Places Concurrently

Sometimes we want to change the name of a variable in our code, a common practice in [refactoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring). If that variable is used in multiple places, we

## Organising Folders for SWE101

In SWE101 we will be creating many folders and cloning the starter code multiple times. To keep things organised, I recommend the following folder structure. Note that all files and folders are in lowercase and kebab case \(hyphenated\) for ease of use on the command line.

1. Host all SWE101 code in a folder called `swe101`. Keep this somewhere accessible like your  `Documents` folder.
2. Within the `swe101` folder, for each class session \(there are 13 total\) in SWE101, create a new folder for that day. This means you will have 13 day-specific folders, such as `day1`, `day2`, ..., `day13`.
3. Within each `dayX` folder, create 1 folder for homework exercises and another folder for class-time exercises. These can look like `homework` and `class`, or any other naming scheme that works for you.
4. Within `homework` and `class` folders, keep a separate folder for every exercise you do that requires you to create a new Git repository or clone a new copy of the SWE101 starter code. When cloning the starter code, you can choose to [name the target folder](../4-getting-started-with-code/4-1-intro-to-github.md#clone) to the relevant exercise name. This is so that we do not end up with Git repositories within Git repositories, which can confuse Git and cause issues.
