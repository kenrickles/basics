## Window Snapping

On both Windows and MacOS, there are features to automatically snap windows to standard places on your screen. This is especially helpful when, say, you are coding, and you want to view your code on one side and documentation on another. Without window snapping we need to manually drag our windows and resize them. With window snapping, we can get our windows in the right size and place with a single swipe or keyboard shortcut.

### Windows

Window snapping is built-in to windows, and you can take advantage of it with instructions [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/help/4027324/windows-10-snap-your-windows).

### Mac

Window snapping is not built-in to MacOS, and we will need to download an external program to snap windows. We recommend any of the following. 

1. [Magnet](https://magnet.crowdcafe.com/) \($2.99\) is an actively maintained window snapping app on the Mac App Store.
2. [Spectacle](https://www.spectacleapp.com/) \(free\) is similar to Magnet, but is no longer actively maintained, which means that it may stop working when Apple makes changes to MacOS.
