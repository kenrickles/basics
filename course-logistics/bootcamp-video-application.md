# üßë‚Äçüè´ Bootcamp Video Application

## Introduction

Rocket Academy requires all prospective Bootcamp students submit a 3-5 minute video application describing a concept they have learned from Basics. Students need not spend too much time on this; we are looking to see how students might explain a concept to a friend. Thank you for your help!

## Motivation

Software engineering requires a high level of written and verbal communication: written communication to help team members understand one's planning documents and code, and verbal communication to discuss and decide on requirements with one's team.

Because communication skills are more challenging to teach in a short time frame than technical skills, RA requires that incoming Bootcamp students have strong baseline communication skills. RA evaluates written communication via code reviews on Basics projects and verbal communication via this video application.

## Requirements

1. Record a 3-5 minute video of you explaining a concept you learned from Basics to a friend \(or better, to a kid or parent\). Feel free to choose a topic from any day of Basics as your subject.
2. Upload this video to YouTube and submit the link to [https://forms.gle/Wm2SU2JQgLSvx14MA](https://forms.gle/Wm2SU2JQgLSvx14MA). Ensure that the link is not private so that RA can view the video.
3. Please do not read off a script. RA is looking for students that can explain coding concepts clearly and engagingly to others. We are more interested in your ability to communicate concepts than the perfection of your speech.
