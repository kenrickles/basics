# üßëüè´ Course Methodology

## Class Organisation

Each cohort will be split into sections of no more than 20 students. Each section will be led by a section leader from RA, who will be the primary point of contact for that section during Coding Basics, and assisted by an Assistant Section Leader. Sections are assigned randomly and fixed for the duration of the course. Students will meet with their respective sections for classes to maximise interaction and learning. Students will be able to interact with students from other sections via Slack.

## Exercise, Project Strategy

Please read through all sections of exercises and projects before starting. Later parts of exercises and projects may require different code architecture than earlier parts. **Failure to take into consideration all aspects of the project might result in a lengthy refactor.**

### Base, More Comfortable

To accommodate different learning speeds and prior experience, exercises and projects may have different sections to differentiate what must be completed to minimally understand concepts, and what are extra exercises or features to help solidify one's understanding.

#### Base

Everything in the Base section must be completed to minimally understand relevant concepts. When short on time, we can complete the Base section then move onto the next exercise or project.

#### More Comfortable

The More Comfortable section is for students that wish to push their boundaries. Students can complete Coding Basics without touching More Comfortable, but students that complete More Comfortable exercises will gain more experience and may be more valuable in the job market.
