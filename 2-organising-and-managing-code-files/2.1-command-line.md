# 2.1: Command Line

## Introduction

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/iRnFyFMvH1o" caption="" %}

The command line is the interface to the computer that consists only of text characters.

We'll be using the command line to run our Git version control system for all the code we write.

## Terminology

The words "**command line**" and "**terminal**" are synonymous. We will be using them interchangeably.

The "terminal" used to refer to a piece of actual hardware when computers were the size of rooms, but has since lost it's original meaning.

<<<<<<< HEAD
You might get stuck in a different kind of command line interface \(there are many\)- another universal way to get out is `Ctrl+C` \(In a Mac, this is also still `Ctrl` \*not\* `Cmd` **⌘\).**
=======
We normally work with _**folders**_, inside of our graphical windows. The Unix terminology is _**directories.**_ For our work in the command line, both are correct.

## Common Commands

We will cover the commands that mimic the kinds of file and folder manipulation tasks you would accomplish through clicking and dragging in a graphical interface.

At any time you can type the `tab` key and the command line will try to auto complete for you. This works for the names of commands and also longer file or folder names.

### pwd

Your command line window already has a "location". See the _**absolute**_ path of that location with `pwd`.

```text
pwd
```

### ls

See the files in your current directory. `ls` accepts a Unix path argument \(denoted below as `<path>`\). If we leave it blank it means `.`, or the current Unix directory.

```text
ls
```

### cd

Move your current directory. Running `cd` without an argument is equivalent to `cd ~`, or "`cd` to the home directory".

```text
cd boating/sails
```

### touch

Create a plain text file. A plain text file is one that only contains characters. You can't `touch` an image file or a Word Document file.

Working with files is easier in the command line if they don't have spaces in them. If you want two words in your file, separate them with a dash.

```text
touch my-filename.txt
```

### mkdir

Create a directory

```text
mkdir skateboards
```

### cp

Copy a file

```text
cp sails.txt new-sails.txt
```

Copy a folder

```text
cp -R boat-folder yatch-folder
```

### mv

Move a file or folder

```text
mv old-folder/cats.txt new-folder
```

Rename a file or folder

```text
mv cats.txt my-cats.txt
```

### rm

{% hint style="danger" %}
Your removed files **DO NOT** go to a trash bin. **Removing is irreversible.**

**Never, ever, ever** try to run a command that removes the root directory or any other folder you don't want to lose forever.
{% endhint %}

Remove a file

```text
rm my-friends.txt
```

Remove a folder

```text
rm -r my-boat-folder
```

## Special Paths

There are a few special characters that stand in for locations in relative paths.

### Root

The folder that contains all your other folders on your computer. On Windows, this is the `C:\` drive.

```text
/
```

An absolute path always begins with the root directory.

```text
cd /Users/susan/Documents/boating
```

### Home

The home folder of your login user

```text
~
```

Go to your current login user's home folder.

```text
cd ~
```

### Current Directory

The directory you're currently in

```text
.
```

Copy something into the directory you're currently in.

```text
cp ~/my-report.txt .
```

### Parent Directory

The directory one level above your current directory

```text
..
```

Move the current terminal location to the current location's parent directory

```text
cd ..
```

## Command Line Options

Almost every command has options you can add, like `-R` with `cp` . If you want to see all the options available, try `man` or adding `--help` at the end of a command. For `man` and `cp` it would be `man cp` . Press `q` to get out.

If you want to accomplish something specific on the command line, googling for a specific combination of options usually works.

## Troubleshooting the Command Line

The command line has many different sub functionalities. If you get lost here are a few tips.

### q

There are certain interfaces that bring us into a page navigator, like the command for help with commands, `man`. `man` tells us how to use Unix commands. You use it by typing something like `man ls` - tell me about the `ls` command. It will change the interface to a page interface that you can navigate with the up and down arrow keys ↑↓. To get out of this interface, press `q` to quit. Some Git commands also bring you into this interface, such as `diff` and `log` which we'll see in the next section.

### Ctrl+C

Many command-line interfaces run programs that can be exited with `Ctrl+C`, which sends an [interruption signal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control-C) to the program in the foreground. On a Mac, this is still `Ctrl` and not `Cmd`.

## Cheat Sheet

Current directory

```text
pwd
```

Contents of current directory

```text
ls
```

Change directory

```text
cd
```

Make an empty text file

```text
touch script.js
```

Copy a file

```text
cp cakes.txt cupcakes.txt
```

Copy a folder

```text
cp -R pastries new-pastries
```

Move a file or folder

```text
mv dogs.txt pets.txt
```

Remove a file

```text
rm donut-list.txt
```

Remove a folder

```text
rm -r my-boats
```

## Pro Tip: Tab Complete

Use the `tab` key on your keyboard to auto-complete partially-typed file or folder names. This can save us a lot of typing!
