# Day 5

**Wrap-up / Look Ahead**

In this section we added onto the total amount of values our programs deal with by writing a new variable for each global value. Next, we'll see a new way to think about multiple values by grouping them into lists called arrays. This is a structure that is not just a dynamic value but a dynamic list of single values, thereby expanding the number of values our programs can deal with even more.

We'll also see loops, the next level of control flow where our code an repeat a set number of times.

After the next meeting we'll put together arrays and loops.
