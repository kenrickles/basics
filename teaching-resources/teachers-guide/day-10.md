# Day 10: Coding Strategies

## Overview

This day is a sample implementation of a complete game, again, without adding any new syntax this section models how to actually code something using all the syntaxes already covered, and talks about faking cards, debugging and, at the beginning of a project how to start thinking about the code that needs to be written.  
  
Reiterate to the students how important the process and approach to the code and what was covered in [Coding Strategies](../../course-logistics/coding-strategies.md) is important.
