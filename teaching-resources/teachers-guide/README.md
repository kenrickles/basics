# Teacher's Guide

#### Tips to remember before starting a session:

Take 15-30 minutes to review the material for the day.

Run the code examples and make sure you are familiar with how they work.

#### Tips to remember during the session:

Begin on time.

When speaking about code, also demonstrate what you are talking about. Don't leave it to students to imagine how the code is while you're speaking. Show them directly.

Try to let the students talk and explain more than you are.

#### TIps to remember during pairing:

If, according to the pairing schedule, one in a pair is missing, use your judgement to pair them up with others.

If possible don't pair anyone who didn't review the material at all.

Try to remind pairs that don't seem to be working well together what the ideal pairing session looks like.

#### Tips to remember after the session:

Take note of anyone who didn't show up. Attempt to contact them on slack.
