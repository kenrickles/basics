# What is Coding?

Coding is the act of writing computer code to form a computer program.

The process of coding includes:

* translating a set of input data into a set of abstractions inside a computer
* defining what operations the computer performs on that data
* determining what output the computer gives and the representation of that output

At their core, all programs, small and large, boil down to this: **instructions to a computer to process an input and give an output**.

#### How many pieces of software can you think of that you use on a daily basis that you don't access through a personal digital device? \(Phone, tablet, laptop, etc.\)

#### How do you give input to this software, how does it give you output?

#### Example: An ATM, your rice cooker, an escalator you take every day.
