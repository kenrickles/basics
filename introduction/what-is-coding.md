## What is Coding?

Coding is the act of writing computer code to form a computer program.

The process of coding includes:

* translating a set of input data into a set of abstractions inside a computer
* defining what operations the computer performs on that data
* determining what output the computer gives and the representation of that output

## What is a Program?

At their core, all programs, small and large, boil down to this: **instructions to a computer to process an input and give an output**.
