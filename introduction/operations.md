# Operations

Coding means writing instructions for the computer to execute.

We will begin with the most basic kinds of instructions the computer can execute, which is an operation between 2 data values.

## **Setup**

1. Open a new tab in the Chrome browser. \(file menu -&gt; new tab _or_ `cmd + t`\)
2. Open Chrome Developer Tools. \(View -&gt; Developer -&gt; JavaScript Console _or_ `cmd + option + i` _or_ right click anywhere in the Chrome window and choose `inspect`\)
3. Make sure you've selected the JavaScript Console tab in dev tools.

## Math Operations

The JavaScript language is capable of calculating math operations.

Type these one at a time into the console and hit enter:

```javascript
2 + 2
```

```javascript
4 * 2
```

```javascript
4 / 2
```

```javascript
4 - 2
```

## Data

Our programs will soon have the ability to process data.

First we need to talk about what data is inside a program and how it's represented.
